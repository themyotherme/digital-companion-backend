CHAPTER SIXTEEN

The Lord’s Opulence
In this chapter the Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, describes His manifest opulences in terms of His specific potencies of knowledge, strength, influence, and so on.
Śrī Uddhava offered glorification to Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and ultimate shelter of all holy places, saying, “The Supreme Lord has no beginning and no end. He is the cause of the birth, maintenance and destruction of all living entities. He is the soul of all beings, and by secretly taking up residence within all living bodies He sees everything. The conditioned souls, on the other hand, are bewildered by His external energy and thus are unable to see Him.” After offering such prayers at the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Uddhava revealed his desire to know about the Lord’s various opulences in heaven, on earth, in hell and in all directions. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa then described all these opulences, after which He commented that all power, beauty, fame, opulence, humility, charity, charm, good fortune, valor, tolerance and wisdom — wherever they are manifest — are simply expansions from Himself. It therefore cannot be truthfully said that a material object actually possesses these opulences. Such conceptions are the results of mentally combining two ideas to produce an object that exists only in the imagination, such as a sky flower. Material opulences are not substantially true, and therefore one should not become too involved in meditating upon them. The pure devotees of the Supreme Lord utilize their intelligence to properly regulate the activities of their speech, mind and vital force and thus perfect their existence in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

श्रीउद्धव उवाच
त्वं ब्रह्म परमं साक्षादनाद्यन्तमपावृतम् ।
सर्वेषामपि भावानां त्राणस्थित्यप्ययोद्भ‍व: ॥ १ ॥
śrī-uddhava uvāca
tvaṁ brahma paramaṁ sākṣād
anādy-antam apāvṛtam
sarveṣām api bhāvānāṁ
trāṇa-sthity-apyayodbhavaḥ
Synonyms
śrī-uddhavaḥ uvāca — Śrī Uddhava said; tvam — You are; brahma — the greatest; paramam — the supreme; sākṣāt — Himself; anādi — without beginning; antam — without end; apāvṛtam — unlimited by anything else; sarveṣām — of all; api — indeed; bhāvānām — things which exist; trāṇa — the protector; sthiti — the life-giver; apyaya — the destruction; udbhavaḥ — and the creation.
Translation
Śrī Uddhava said: My dear Lord, You are beginningless and endless, the Absolute Truth Himself, unlimited by anything else. You are the protector and life-giver, the destruction and creation of all things that exist.
Purport
Brahma means the greatest of all and the cause of everything. Uddhava here addresses the Lord as the paramam, or supreme brahma, because in His feature as Bhagavān the Lord is the highest feature of the Absolute Truth and the shelter of unlimited spiritual opulences. Unlike those of ordinary living entities, the Lord’s opulences cannot be restricted by time, and thus the Lord is anādy-antam, without beginning or end, and apāvṛtam, unhindered by any superior or equal potency. The opulence of the material world is also resting within the Lord, who alone can protect, maintain, create and destroy the material world. In this chapter, Śrī Uddhava inquires from the Lord about His spiritual and material opulences in order to refine his appreciation of the Lord’s position as the Absolute Truth. Even Lord Viṣṇu, the ultimate creator of the material world, is an expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus Śrī Uddhava wishes to fully appreciate the unique status of his personal friend.

उच्चावचेषु भूतेषु दुर्ज्ञेयमकृतात्मभि: ।
उपासते त्वां भगवन् याथातथ्येन ब्राह्मणा: ॥ २ ॥
uccāvaceṣu bhūteṣu
durjñeyam akṛtātmabhiḥ
upāsate tvāṁ bhagavan
yāthā-tathyena brāhmaṇāḥ
Synonyms
ucca — in the superior; avaceṣu — and the inferior; bhūteṣu — created objects and entities; durjñeyam — hard to understand; akṛta-ātmabhiḥ — by the impious; upāsate — they worship; tvām — You; bhagavan — my dear Lord; yāthā-tathyena — in truth; brāhmaṇāḥ — those dedicated to the Vedic conclusion.
Translation
My dear Lord, although it is difficult for the impious to understand that You are situated in all superior and inferior creations, those brāhmaṇas who are actual knowers of the Vedic conclusion worship You in truth.
Purport
The behavior of saintly persons is also to be taken as evidence, and therefore it is here stated that although ignorant, impious persons are bewildered before the Lord’s all-pervading feature, those with purified, clear consciousness worship the Lord as He is. In this chapter Śrī Uddhava inquires about the Lord’s opulences, and here the words uccāvaceṣu bhūteṣu (“within superior and inferior creations”) clearly refer to the Lord’s external opulences, those manifested in the material world. The saintly brāhmaṇas, or Vaiṣṇavas, worship Lord Kṛṣṇa within all things and yet recognize the variety in the Lord’s creation. For example, in worshiping the Deity, the devotees will select the nicest flowers, fruits and ornaments for decorating the transcendental form of the Lord. Similarly, although the Lord is present in the heart of every conditioned soul, the devotee will give more attention to a conditioned soul interested in the message of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Although the Lord is everywhere, the devotees make distinctions, for the sake of the Lord’s service, between His presence in superior (ucca) and inferior (avaceṣu) creations.

येषु येषु च भूतेषु भक्त्या त्वां परमर्षय: ।
उपासीना: प्रपद्यन्ते संसिद्धिं तद् वदस्व मे ॥ ३ ॥
yeṣu yeṣu ca bhūteṣu
bhaktyā tvāṁ paramarṣayaḥ
upāsīnāḥ prapadyante
saṁsiddhiṁ tad vadasva me
Synonyms
yeṣu yeṣu — in which various; ca — also; bhūteṣu — forms; bhaktyā — with devotion; tvām — You; parama-ṛṣayaḥ — the great sages; upāsīnāḥ — worshiping; prapadyante — achieve; saṁsiddhim — perfection; tat — that; vadasva — please speak; me — to me.
Translation
Please tell me of the perfections that great sages achieve by worshiping You with devotion. Also, kindly explain which of Your different forms they worship.
Purport
Śrī Uddhava here inquires about the spiritual opulences of the Lord, which consist primarily of His viṣṇu-tattva expansions such as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. By worshiping different plenary expansions of the Lord one achieves particular perfections, and Śrī Uddhava wants to know about this.

गूढश्चरसि भूतात्मा भूतानां भूतभावन ।
न त्वां पश्यन्ति भूतानि पश्यन्तं मोहितानि ते ॥ ४ ॥
gūḍhaś carasi bhūtātmā
bhūtānāṁ bhūta-bhāvana
na tvāṁ paśyanti bhūtāni
paśyantaṁ mohitāni te
Synonyms
gūḍhaḥ — hidden; carasi — You are engaged; bhūta-ātmā — the Supersoul; bhūtānām — of the living entities; bhūta-bhāvana — O maintainer of all living beings; na — not; tvām — You; paśyanti — they see; bhūtāni — living entities; paśyantam — who are seeing; mohitāni — bewildered; te — by You.
Translation
O my Lord, maintainer of all, although You are the Supersoul of the living entities, You remain hidden. Thus being bewildered by You, the living entities cannot see You, although You are seeing them.
Purport
The Lord exists as the Supersoul within everything. He also appears in various incarnations or sometimes empowers a devotee to act as an incarnation. All such forms of the Lord are unknown to the nondevotees. The bewildered conditioned souls think that the supreme enjoyer, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is actually meant to be enjoyed by them for their sense gratification. Praying to God for specific material benedictions and assuming God’s creation to be their personal property, the nondevotees cannot understand the actual form of the Lord. They therefore remain foolish and bewildered. Within the universe everything is subject to creation, maintenance and destruction, and thus the Supersoul is the only actual controller in the material world. Unfortunately, when the Supersoul appears in various incarnations to clarify His position, ignorant persons think that the Supersoul is merely another creation of the modes of material nature. As stated in this verse, they cannot see that person who is actually seeing them, and simply remain bewildered.

Translation
O supremely potent Lord, please explain to me Your innumerable potencies, which You manifest on the earth, in heaven, in hell and indeed in all directions. I offer my humble obeisances at Your lotus feet, which are the shelter of all holy places.
Purport
Uddhava here inquires about the Lord’s material and spiritual potencies, as manifested within our universe. Just as ordinary animals or insects living in human cities cannot appreciate the scientific, cultural or military achievements of man, similarly, foolish materialists cannot appreciate the mighty opulences of the Personality of Godhead, even those manifested within our universe. For the appreciation of ordinary human beings Uddhava requests the Lord to reveal exactly how and in what forms He expands His potencies. As already explained, the Lord is the essential ingredient of all that exists, and thus any mighty or opulent manifestation must ultimately rest on the Lord Himself.

Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa was pleased that His two friends, Arjuna and Uddhava, had posed the same question regarding the opulences of the Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa considered it wonderful that His two dear friends had asked exactly the same question.

He therefore desisted from the battle, thinking, “I would be the killer of my relatives. They would be destroyed.” Thus Arjuna was afflicted with mundane consciousness.
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa here explains to Uddhava the circumstances in which Śrī Arjuna posed his questions.

Translation
My dear Uddhava, I am the Supersoul of all living entities, and therefore I am naturally their well-wisher and supreme controller. Being the creator, maintainer and annihilator of all entities, I am not different from them.
Purport
Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that the Personality of Godhead maintains an ablative and genitive relationship with His opulences. In other words, the Lord is not different from all living entities, because they are coming from Him and they belong to Him. The Lord gave a similar explanation to Arjuna in the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā (10.20), beginning with the same words, aham ātmā. Although the Lord describes His external, or material, opulences, the Lord’s position is always transcendental and nonmaterial. Just as the living soul within the body gives life to the body, similarly, the Lord, by His supreme potency, gives life to all universal opulences.

Oṣadhīnām here indicates those plants that fructify once and then die. Among them, those that give grains, which sustain human life, represent Kṛṣṇa. Without grains it is not possible to produce milk products, nor can one properly perform Vedic fire sacrifices without offerings of grains.

yogānām ātma-saṁrodho
mantro ’smi vijigīṣatām
ānvīkṣikī kauśalānāṁ
vikalpaḥ khyāti-vādinām
Synonyms
yogānām — among the eight stages of yoga practice (aṣṭāṅga); ātma-saṁrodhaḥ — the ultimate stage, samādhi, in which the soul is completely separated from illusion; mantraḥ — prudent political counsel; asmi — I am; vijigīṣatām — among those desiring victory; ānvīkṣikī — spiritual science, by which one can distinguish between matter and spirit; kauśalānām — among all processes of expert discrimination; vikalpaḥ — diversity of perception; khyāti-vādinām — among the speculative philosophers.
Translation
Among the eight progressive states of yoga I am the final stage, samādhi, in which the soul is completely separated from illusion. Among those desiring victory I am prudent political counsel, and among processes of expert discrimination I am the science of the soul, by which one distinguishes spirit from matter. Among all speculative philosophers I am diversity of perception.
Purport
Any science is based on the faculty of expert discrimination. By skillful definition of isolated and interactive components one becomes expert in any field. Ultimately the most intelligent person can isolate the spirit soul from matter and describe the properties of matter and spirit as both isolated and interactive components of reality. The proliferation of innumerable philosophical speculations is due to differing modes of perception within the material world. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā (15.15), sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart and awards a particular degree of knowledge or ignorance according to one’s desire and merit. Thus the Lord Himself is the basis of the mundane process of philosophical speculation, for He creates differing and alternating modes of perception within the conditioned souls. It is to be understood that one can acquire perfect knowledge only by hearing directly from Lord Kṛṣṇa and not by hearing from conditioned philosophers who imperfectly perceive the creation of the Lord through the screen of their personal desires.

Synonyms
dharmāṇām — among religious principles; asmi — I am; sannyāsaḥ — renunciation; kṣemāṇām — among all types of security; abahiḥ-matiḥ — awareness within (of the eternal soul); guhyānām — of secrets; sunṛtam — pleasant speech; maunam — silence; mithunānām — of sexual pairs; ajaḥ — Brahmā, the original prajāpati; tu — indeed; aham — I am.
Translation
Among religious principles I am renunciation, and of all types of security I am consciousness of the eternal soul within. Of secrets I am pleasant speech and silence, and among sexual pairs I am Brahmā.
Purport
One who realizes the eternal soul within no longer fears any material situation and thus is qualified to accept the renounced order of life, sannyāsa. Certainly fear is one of the great miseries of material life; therefore the gift of fearlessness is very valuable and represents Lord Kṛṣṇa. Both in ordinary pleasant speech and silence, very few confidential things are revealed, and thus diplomacy and silence are both aids to secrecy. Lord Brahmā is prominent among sexual pairs because the original beautiful couple, Svāyambhuva Manu and Śatarūpā, emerged from Lord Brahmā’s body, as explained in Chapter Twelve of the Third Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

Translation
Among those entitled to the name Bhagavān I am Vāsudeva, and indeed, you, Uddhava, represent Me among the devotees. I am Hanumān among the Kimpuruṣas, and among the Vidyādharas I am Sudarśana.
Purport
The Vedic literatures state that one who possesses perfect knowledge of the creation and destruction of all entities and who is completely situated in omniscience is to be known as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. Although many great personalities are sometimes called Bhagavān, ultimately Bhagavān is the one supreme entity who possesses unlimited opulences. Throughout history, many important personalities have been addressed as “lord,” but ultimately there is only one Supreme Lord. In the Lord’s catur-vyūha, or quadruple expansion, the first manifestation is Vāsudeva, who here represents all of the Lord’s expansions in the viṣṇu-tattva category.

Translation
Among jewels I am the ruby, and among beautiful things I am the lotus cup. Among all types of grass I am the sacred kuśa, and of oblations I am ghee and other ingredients obtained from the cow.
Purport
Pañca-gavya refers to five sacrificial ingredients obtained from the cow, namely milk, ghee, yogurt, dung and urine. The cow is so valuable that even its dung and urine are antiseptic and fit for sacrificial offering. Kuśa grass is also used for religious occasions. Mahārāja Parīkṣit constructed a sitting place from kuśa grass during the last week of his life. Among beautiful things the lotus cup formed by lotus petals represents Lord Kṛṣṇa, and among jewels the ruby, which is similar to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s own Kaustubha gem, symbolizes the potency of the Lord.

Purport
Generally, the Vaiṣṇavas worship the Personality of Godhead as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Nārāyaṇa, Hayagrīva, Varāha, Nṛsiṁha and Brahmā. It is understood that when a suitable living entity is not available to fill the post of Brahmā, the Lord Himself assumes the position; therefore Lord Brahmā is mentioned in the list. Lord Viṣṇu sometimes appears as Indra and sometimes as Brahmā, and it is Viṣṇu appearing as Brahmā who is indicated in this connection.

In Bhagavad-gītā (7.9) Lord Kṛṣṇa says, puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca: “I am the fragrance of the earth.” The original fragrance of the earth is very pleasing and represents Lord Kṛṣṇa. Although unpleasant aromas may be artificially produced, they do not represent the Lord.

Purport
Having given a brief but detailed synopsis of His personal opulences within this world, the Lord now briefly summarizes the opulences that expand from His bodily effulgence. It is stated in Brahma-saṁhitā that all of the material universes with their infinite varieties, transformations and opulences rest on the bodily effulgence of the Lord. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has elaborately explained this point in his commentary on this verse.

Translation
As the Supreme Lord I am the basis of the living entity, of the modes of nature and of the mahat-tattva. Thus I am everything, and nothing whatsoever can exist without Me.
Purport
Without the manifestation of the mahat-tattva, or total material existence, and the jīva, or living entity, nothing can exist within the material world. Everything we experience is a combination of the living entity and matter, in its various subtle and gross categories. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the entire basis of the existence of both the living entity and matter. Nothing can possibly exist even for a moment without the mercy of the Supreme Lord. One should not foolishly conclude that the Lord is therefore material. As has been clearly explained in this canto of the Bhāgavatam, both the living entity and the Supreme Lord are completely transcendental to material nature. The living entity, however, has the propensity to dream that he is material, whereas the Lord constantly remembers the transcendental position of both Himself and the conditioned dreaming entity. As the Lord is transcendental, His abode is also far beyond the reach of the modes of nature. The actual purpose of life is to understand by mature conviction the transcendental Lord, His transcendental abode, our own transcendental position and the process by which we may go back home, back to Godhead.

Translation
Even though over a period of time I might count all the atoms of the universe, I could not count all of My opulences which I manifest within innumerable universes.
Purport
The Lord here explains that Uddhava should not expect a complete catalog of the Lord’s opulences, since even the Lord Himself finds no limit to such opulences. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, kālena indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is within every atom and can therefore easily calculate the total number of atoms. However, although the Lord is certainly omniscient, even He Himself cannot supply a finite number for His opulences, because they are infinite.

Translation
I have briefly described to you all My spiritual opulences and also the extraordinary material features of My creation, which are perceived by the mind and defined in different ways according to circumstances.
Purport
According to Sanskrit grammar, and as confirmed by Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the words etāḥ and ete describe two distinct sets of the Lord’s opulences. The Lord has described His opulent plenary expansions, such as Vāsudeva, Nārāyaṇa, the Supersoul, etc., and further the Lord has described the outstanding features of the material creation, which are also included among the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The plenary manifestations of the Lord, such as Vāsudeva, Nārāyaṇa, etc., are all eternal, unchanging transcendental features of the Lord and are indicated by the term etāḥ. The extraordinary aspects of material creation, however, are circumstantial and dependent on individual perception, and they are therefore described here by the words mano-vikārā evaite yathā vācābhidhīyate. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that by consistent logical application of synonyms, etāḥ refers to the Lord’s eternal spiritual manifestations, beyond the perception of the material senses, whereas ete refers to those opulences that can be perceived by conditioned souls. He gives the example that the paraphernalia and intimate associates of a king are all considered to be part and parcel of the king and are therefore granted royal status. Similarly, the opulent features of material creation are reflected expansions of the Lord’s personal opulences and thus may be considered nondifferent from Him. One should not, however, wrongly assume that such insignificant material opulences occupy the same status as the Lord’s plenary features as the Personality of Godhead, which are qualitatively and quantitatively equal to the Lord.
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments as follows on this verse. “The Lord’s external opulences are called mano-vikārāḥ, or ‘related to mental transformation,’ because ordinary people perceive extraordinary features of the material world according to their personal state of mind. Thus the word vācābhidhīyate indicates that conditioned souls describe the Lord’s material creation according to specific material circumstances. Because of the circumstantial relative definitions of material opulence, such opulence is never to be considered a direct plenary manifestation of the Lord’s personal form. When one’s state of mind is transformed into a favorable or affectionate state, one defines a manifestation of the Lord’s energy as ‘my son,’ ‘my father,’ ‘my husband,’ ‘my uncle,’ ‘the son of my brother,’ ‘my friend,’ and so on. One forgets that every living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that whatever opulences, talents or outstanding features one may exhibit are actually the potencies of the Lord. Similarly, when the mind is transformed into a negative or inimical state, one thinks, ‘This person will be the ruin of me,’ ‘This person must be finished by me,’ ‘He is my enemy’ or ‘I am his enemy,’ ‘He is a killer’ or ‘He should be killed.’ The negative state of mind is also expressed when one is attracted to the extraordinary material aspects of particular persons or objects but forgets that they are manifestations of the potency of the Personality of Godhead. Even the demigod Indra, who is quite obviously a manifestation of the Lord’s material opulences, is misunderstood by others. For example, Indra’s wife, Śacī, thinks that Indra is ‘my husband,’ whereas Aditi thinks that he is ‘my son.’ Jayanta thinks that he is ‘my father,’ Bṛhaspati thinks that he is ‘my disciple,’ whereas the demons feel that Indra is their personal enemy. Thus different personalities define him according to their mental state. The Lord’s material opulences, being relatively perceived, are therefore called mano-vikāra, which means they are dependent on mental states. This relative perception is material because it does not recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual source of the particular opulence. If one sees Lord Kṛṣṇa as the source of all opulences and gives up all desires to enjoy or possess the Lord’s opulences, then one can see the spiritual nature of these opulences. At that time, even though one may continue to perceive the variety and distinctions of the material world, one will become perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One should not conclude, as do the voidist philosophers, that the Lord’s spiritual manifestations in the viṣṇu-tattva and liberated jīva categories are also products of relative perception and mental states. This useless idea is contrary to the entire body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s teachings to Śrī Uddhava.”
According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the word vācā also indicates the various Vedic literatures that describe the particular processes by which the Lord manifests His spiritual and material opulences, and in this context yathā indicates the specific procedures of manifestation and creation.

Translation
Therefore, control your speaking, subdue the mind, conquer the life air, regulate the senses and through purified intelligence bring your rational faculties under control. In this way you will never again fall onto the path of material existence.
Purport
One should see all things as expansions of the Supreme Lord’s potency, and thus with speech, mind and senses one should offer respect to all things, without minimizing any living entity or material object. Since everything belongs to the Lord, everything ultimately should be engaged in the Lord’s service with great care. A self-realized devotee tolerates personal insult and does not become envious of any living entity, nor does he see anyone as his enemy. This is practical enlightenment. Although a pure devotee may criticize those who obstruct the Lord’s mission, such criticism is never personally motivated nor is it ever based on enviousness. An advanced devotee of the Lord may chastise his followers or criticize the demoniac, but only to carry out the mission of the Supreme Lord and never out of personal enmity or enviousness. For one who completely gives up the material concept of life there is no possibility of entering again onto the path of birth and death.
Text 43
यो वै वाङ्‍मनसी सम्यगसंयच्छन् धिया यति: ।
तस्य व्रतं तपो दानं स्रवत्यामघटाम्बुवत् ॥ ४३ ॥
yo vai vāṅ-manasī saṁyag
asaṁyacchan dhiyā yatiḥ
tasya vrataṁ tapo dānaṁ
sravaty āma-ghaṭāmbu-vat
Synonyms
yaḥ — one who; vai — certainly; vāk-manasī — the speech and mind; saṁyak — completely; asaṁyacchan — not controlling; dhiyā — by intelligence; yatiḥ — a transcendentalist; tasya — his; vratam — vows; tapaḥ — austerities; dānam — charity; sravati — run out; āma — unbaked; ghaṭa — in a pot; ambu-vat — like water.
Translation
A transcendentalist who does not completely control his words and mind by superior intelligence will find that his spiritual vows, austerities and charity flow away just as water flows out of an unbaked clay pot.
Purport
When a clay pot is properly baked it holds any liquid substance without leakage. If a clay pot is not properly baked, however, water or any other liquid within it will seep out and be lost. Similarly, a transcendentalist who does not control his speech and mind will find that his spiritual discipline and austerity gradually seep away and are lost. Dāna, or “charity,” refers to work performed for the welfare of others. Those who are trying to give the highest charity by preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness should not engage in speaking cleverly for the satisfaction of beautiful women, nor should they attempt to become artificially intellectual simply for the sake of mundane academic prestige. One should not even think of intimate sexual relationships, nor should one daydream of acquiring a prestigious position. Otherwise, one’s determination to strictly practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be lost, as described here. One must control the mind, senses and speech by higher intelligence so that one’s life will be successful.
Text 44
तस्माद्वचोमन:प्राणान् नियच्छेन्मत्परायण: ।
मद्भ‍‍क्तियुक्तया बुद्ध्या तत: परिसमाप्यते ॥ ४४ ॥
tasmād vaco manaḥ prāṇān
niyacchen mat-parāyaṇaḥ
mad-bhakti-yuktayā buddhyā
tataḥ parisamāpyate
Synonyms
tasmāt — therefore; vacaḥ — words; manaḥ — the mind; prāṇān — the life airs; niyacchet — one should control; mat-parāyaṇaḥ — who is devoted to Me; mat — unto Me; bhakti — with devotion; yuktayā — endowed; buddhyā — by such intelligence; tataḥ — thus; parisamāpyate — one fulfills the mission of life.
Translation
Being surrendered to Me, one should control the speech, mind and life air, and then through loving devotional intelligence one will completely fulfill the mission of life.
Purport
One can develop loving devotional intelligence by perfectly chanting the Brahma-gāyatrī mantra awarded at the moment of brāhmaṇa initiation. By clear intelligence, one becomes naturally and spontaneously disinterested in the rewards offered by mental speculation and fruitive activities and takes full shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Lord’s Opulence.”
