CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond
To establish the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this chapter describes the various functional manifestations of the three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), which arise in the mind.
Control of the mind, control of the senses, tolerance and so forth are manifestations of the unmixed mode of goodness. Desire, endeavor, false pride and so on are manifestations of the unmixed mode of passion. And anger, greed and bewilderment are among the functions of the unmixed mode of ignorance. In the admixture of the three modes we find the concept of “I” and “my,” behavior in accordance with this mentality by body, mind and words, adherence to the principles of religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, and the fixed pursuit of one’s occupational duty for material interest.
A person whose character is in the mode of goodness worships Lord Hari in a spirit of devotion, without regard to profit. On the other hand, one who hankers after the fruits of his worship of the Lord is passionate by nature. And one who desires violence is in the mode of ignorance. These modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are present in the infinitesimal living entity, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature.
The substance, place and result of activity, along with the time, the knowledge underlying action, the activity itself, the performer, his faith, his level of awareness, his spiritual progress and his destination after death, all partake of the three modes and manifest variously in terms of distinctions and hierarchies. But objects related to the Supreme Personality, places connected with Him, happiness based on Him, the time occupied in His worship, knowledge related to Him, work offered to Him, the performer of work who acts under His shelter, faith in His devotional service, progress toward the spiritual realm, and the destination of the Supreme Lord’s personal abode all transcend the material modes.
There are many different destinations and conditions of life for the spirit soul within the cycle of material existence. These are all based on the modes of nature and on fruitive activities, which are governed by the modes. It is only by practicing the yoga of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord that one can conquer the three modes, which arise originally from the mind. After obtaining a human body, which has the potential for developing knowledge and realization, a person who is intelligent should renounce association with the three modes of nature and then worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First, by increasing the mode of goodness, one can defeat passion and ignorance. Then one can conquer material goodness by evolving his consciousness to the platform of transcendence. At that time he becomes entirely liberated from the material modes, gives up his subtle body (the material mind, intelligence and false ego) and attains the association of the Personality of Godhead. By the shattering of his subtle covering, the living entity is able to come face to face with the Supreme Lord and thus achieve absolute fulfillment by His grace.

śrī-bhagavān uvāca
guṇānām asammiśrāṇāṁ
pumān yena yathā bhavet
tan me puruṣa-varyedam

Synonyms
śrī-bhagavān uvāca — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; guṇānām — of the modes of nature; asammiśrāṇām — in their unmixed state; pumān — a person; yena — by which mode; yathā — how; bhavet — he becomes; tat — that; me — by Me; puruṣa-varya — O best among men; idam — this; upadhāraya — please try to understand; śaṁsataḥ — as I speak.
Translation
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O best among men, please listen as I describe to you how the living entity attains a particular nature by association with individual material modes.
Purport
The word asammiśra indicates that which is not mixed with anything else. Lord Kṛṣṇa now explains how each of the three material modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), acting separately, causes a conditioned soul to manifest a particular type of existence. The living entity is ultimately transcendental to the modes of nature, being part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but in conditioned life he manifests material qualities. This is described in the following verses.

सन्निपातस्त्वहमिति ममेत्युद्धव या मति: ।
व्यवहार: सन्निपातो मनोमात्रेन्द्रियासुभि: ॥ ६ ॥
sannipātas tv aham iti
mamety uddhava yā matiḥ
vyavahāraḥ sannipāto
mano-mātrendriyāsubhiḥ
Synonyms
sannipātaḥ — the combination of the modes; tu — and; aham iti — “I”; mama iti — “mine”; uddhava — O Uddhava; yā — which; matiḥ — mentality; vyavahāraḥ — ordinary activities; sannipātaḥ — the combination; manaḥ — by the mind; mātrā — the objects of perception; indriya — the senses; asubhiḥ — and the vital airs.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the mentality of “I” and “mine.” The ordinary transactions of this world, which are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the combination of the modes.
Purport
The illusory concept of “I” and “mine” occurs by the mixture of the three modes of nature. A person in goodness may feel, “I am peaceful.” One in passion may think, “I am lusty.” And one in ignorance may think, “I am angry.” Similarly, one may think “my peace,” “my lust” or “my anger.” One completely absorbed in the mentality of being peaceful could not work in the material world; he would lack any impulse to perform activity. Similarly, one absorbed in lust would be blinded without at least a tinge of peacefulness or restraint. One overwhelmed with anger could not function properly in the material world without the mixture of other qualities. Thus we find that a material mode does not occur in a pure, isolated form but rather is mixed with other modes, thereby making possible normal functioning within this world. Ultimately one should think, “I am an eternal servant of Lord Kṛṣṇa” and “My only possession is loving service to the Lord.” This is the pure state of consciousness, beyond the material modes of nature.

Translation
When a person devotes himself to religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, the faith, wealth and sensual enjoyment obtained by his endeavors display the interaction of the three modes of nature.
Purport
Religiosity, economic development and sense gratification are situated within the modes of nature, and the faith, wealth and enjoyment obtained by them clearly reveal the particular situation of a person within the modes of nature.

Purport
According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, religious duties performed for promotion to heaven are understood to be in the mode of passion, those performed to enjoy ordinary family life are in the mode of ignorance, and those performed selflessly to fulfill one’s occupational duty in the varṇāśrama system are in the mode of goodness. The Lord has thus explained how mundane religiosity is manifest within the modes of nature.

Text 12
सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणा जीवस्य नैव मे ।
चित्तजा यैस्तु भूतानां सज्जमानो निबध्यते ॥ १२ ॥
sattvaṁ rajas tama iti
guṇā jīvasya naiva me

Translation
The three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — influence the living entity but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the living entity is bound up.
Purport
The living entity is the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, having the tendency to be overwhelmed by the Lord’s illusory material energy. The Personality of Godhead, however, is the absolute controller of illusion. Illusion can never control the Lord. Thus the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the eternal object of service for all living beings, who are eternally servants of the Lord.
The three modes of nature manifest within the material energy. When a conditioned soul adopts a material mentality, the modes exert their influence within the jurisdiction of that mentality. But if one purifies one’s mind in the devotional service of the Lord, the modes of nature can no longer act upon him, since they have no influence on the spiritual platform.

Translation
When the mode of passion, which causes attachment, separatism and activity, conquers ignorance and goodness, a man begins to work hard to acquire prestige and fortune. Thus in the mode of passion he experiences anxiety and struggle.

Translation

Purport
Our original Kṛṣṇa consciousness exists eternally within the soul, and it is also present in all the three phases of awareness, namely normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. Being covered by the modes of nature, this spiritual consciousness may not be manifest, but it continues to exist eternally as the real nature of the living entity.

upary upari gacchanti
sattvena brāhmaṇā janāḥ
tamasādho ’dha ā-mukhyād
rajasāntara-cāriṇaḥ
Synonyms
upari upari — higher and higher; gacchanti — they go; sattvena — by the mode of goodness; brāhmaṇāḥ — persons dedicated to Vedic principles; janāḥ — such men; tamasā — by the mode of ignorance; adhaḥ adhaḥ — lower and lower; ā-mukhyāt — headfirst; rajasā — by the mode of passion; antara-cāriṇaḥ — remaining in intermediate situations.
Translation
Learned persons dedicated to Vedic culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions. The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues transmigrating through human bodies.
Purport
Śūdras, persons in the mode of ignorance, are generally in deep illusion about the purpose of life, accepting the gross material body as the self. Those in passion and ignorance are called vaiśyas and hanker intensely for wealth, whereas kṣatriyas, who are in the mode of passion, are eager for prestige and power. Those in the mode of goodness, however, hanker after perfect knowledge; they are therefore called brāhmaṇas. Such a person is promoted up to the supreme material position of Brahmaloka, the planet of Lord Brahmā. One who is in the mode of ignorance gradually falls to the level of unmoving species, such as trees and stones, while one in the mode of passion, filled with material desire but satisfying it within Vedic culture, is allowed to remain in human society.

Translation
Those who leave this world in the mode of goodness go to the heavenly planets, those who pass away in the mode of passion remain in the world of human beings, and those dying in the mode of ignorance must go to hell. But those who are free from the influence of all modes of nature come to Me.

Purport
Ordinary work performed as an offering to God, without desire for the result, is understood to be in the mode of goodness, whereas activities of devotion — such as chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord — are transcendental forms of work beyond the modes of nature.

Absolute knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be transcendental.
Purport
The Lord clearly explains here that spiritual knowledge of His supreme personality is transcendental to ordinary religious knowledge in the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness one understands the existence of a higher spiritual nature within all things. In the mode of passion one acquires scientific knowledge of the material body. And in the mode of ignorance one fixes one’s mind on the sense objects without higher awareness, perceiving things as a small child or a retarded person does.
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī elaborately explains in his commentary on this verse that the material mode of goodness does not award perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He quotes from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (6.14.2), proving that many great demigods in the mode of goodness could not understand the transcendental personality of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the material mode of goodness, one becomes pious or religious, aware of a higher, spiritual nature. On the spiritual platform of purified goodness, however, one establishes a direct, loving relationship with the Absolute Truth, rendering service to the Lord rather than merely maintaining a connection to mundane piety. In the mode of passion the conditioned soul speculates about the reality of his own existence and of the world around him, and considers speculatively the existence of a kingdom of God. In the mode of ignorance one acquires knowledge for sense gratification, absorbing the mind in varieties of eating, sleeping, defending and sex, without any higher purpose. Thus, within the modes of nature the conditioned souls are trying to gratify their senses, or else they are trying to free themselves from sense gratification. But they cannot directly engage themselves in their constitutional, liberated activities until they come to the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, beyond the modes of nature.

वनं तु सात्त्विको वासो ग्रामो राजस उच्यते ।
तामसं द्यूतसदनं मन्निकेतं तु निर्गुणम् ॥ २५ ॥
vanaṁ tu sāttviko vāso
grāmo rājasa ucyate
tāmasaṁ dyūta-sadanaṁ
man-niketaṁ tu nirguṇam
Synonyms
vanam — the forest; tu — whereas; sāttvikaḥ — in the mode of goodness; vāsaḥ — residence; grāmaḥ — the village neighborhood; rājasaḥ — in the mode of passion; ucyate — is said; tāmasam — in the mode of ignorance; dyūta-sadanam — the gambling house; mat-niketam — My residence; tu — but; nirguṇam — transcendental.
Translation
Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental.
Purport
Many creatures in the forest, such as the trees, wild boars and insects, are actually in the modes of passion and ignorance. But residence in the forest is designated as being in the mode of goodness because there one may live a solitary life free from sinful activities, material opulence and passionate ambition. Throughout the history of India, many millions of persons from all walks of life have adopted the orders of vānaprastha and sannyāsa and have gone to sacred forests to practice austerity and perfect their self-realization. Even in America and other Western countries, persons such as Thoreau achieved fame by retiring to the forest to reduce the scope and opulence of material involvement.
The word grāma here indicates residence in the village of one’s family. Family life is certainly full of false pride, false hopes, false affection, lamentation and illusion, since the family connection is squarely resting on the bodily concept of life, the very opposite of self-realization. The word dyūta-sadanam, “gambling house,” refers to pool halls, racetracks, poker clubs, bars and other sinful places that maintain an abysmal level of consciousness in the mode of ignorance. Man-niketam refers to the Lord’s own abode in the spiritual world as well as the Lord’s temples within this world, wherein the Deity form of the Lord is appropriately worshiped. One who lives in the temple of Lord Kṛṣṇa, following the rules and regulations of temple life, is understood to be residing on the transcendental platform. In these verses the Lord clearly explains that all material phenomena may be divided into three divisions according to the modes of nature, and that ultimately there is the fourth, or transcendental, division — Kṛṣṇa consciousness — which elevates all aspects of human culture to the liberated platform.

Translation
A worker free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has taken shelter of Me is understood to be transcendental to the modes of nature.
Purport
A transcendental worker performs his activities in strict accordance with the directions of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the Lord’s bona fide representatives. Taking shelter of the Lord’s guidance, such a worker remains transcendental to the material modes of nature.

Translation
O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate himself to Me by the process of devotional service and thus attain pure love for Me.
Purport
The words mad-bhāvāya prapadyate indicate the attainment of love for God or of the same state of existence as that of the Supreme Lord. Actual liberation is residence within the eternal kingdom of God, where life is full of bliss and knowledge. The conditioned soul falsely imagines himself to be the enjoyer of the modes of nature, and thus a particular type of material work is generated, the reaction of which binds the conditioned soul to repeated birth and death. This fruitless process can be counteracted by loving service to the Lord, as described here.

Purport
The word nairapekṣyeṇa refers to complete detachment from the modes of material nature. By attachment to the loving service of the Lord, which is completely transcendental, one gives up one’s interest in the modes of nature.
Text 36

He no longer searches for enjoyment in the external energy, nor does he contemplate or remember such enjoyment within himself.
Purport
The human form of life is a rare opportunity for achieving spiritual liberation in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Kṛṣṇa has elaborately described in this chapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and the transcendental situation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, by which process we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond.”
