CHAPTER THIRTY

The Disappearance of the Yadu Dynasty
This chapter discusses the destruction of the Yadu dynasty in connection with the winding up of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
After Śrī Uddhava left for Badarikāśrama, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, taking note of many bad omens, advised the Yādavas to abandon Dvārakā and go to Prabhāsa, on the bank of the Sarasvatī, to perform svasty-ayana and other rituals for counteracting bad fortune. They followed His advice and went to Prabhāsa. There they became absorbed in festivity, and by the illusory power of Lord Kṛṣṇa they became intoxicated from drinking liquor. Thus losing their intelligence, they quarreled among themselves and began killing one another, until not a man was left alive.
Afterward, Śrī Baladeva went to the shore of the ocean and by the mystic strength of yoga gave up His body. Seeing the disappearance of Baladeva, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa sat down silently upon the ground. Then a hunter named Jarā, mistaking the sole of the Lord’s left foot for a deer, pierced it with an arrow. The hunter immediately understood his mistake and, falling at the feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, begged to be punished. In reply Lord Kṛṣṇa told the hunter that what he had done was actually according to His own desire. The Lord then sent the hunter to Vaikuṇṭha.
When Dāruka, Kṛṣṇa’s charioteer, arrived on the scene and saw Lord Kṛṣṇa in that condition, he began to lament. Kṛṣṇa told him that he should go to Dvārakā, inform the residents about the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and advise them all to leave Dvārakā for Indraprastha. Dāruka obediently carried out this order.

श्रीराजोवाच
ततो महाभागवत उद्धवे निर्गते वनम् ।
द्वारवत्यां किमकरोद् भगवान् भूतभावन: ॥ १ ॥
śrī-rājovāca
tato mahā-bhāgavata
uddhave nirgate vanam
dvāravatyāṁ kim akarod
bhagavān bhūta-bhāvanaḥ
Synonyms
śrī-rājā uvāca — the king said; tataḥ — then; mahā-bhāgavate — the great devotee; uddhave — Uddhava; nirgate — when he had gone; vanam — to the forest; dvāravatyām — in Dvārakā; kim — what; akarot — did; bhagavān — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhūta — of all living beings; bhāvanaḥ — the protector.
Translation
King Parīkṣit said: After the great devotee Uddhava left for the forest, what did the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the protector of all living beings, do in the city of Dvārakā?
Purport
Parīkṣit Mahārāja now inquires from Śukadeva Gosvāmī about the topic of Chapter One of this canto, namely the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s return to the spiritual sky. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa was playing the part of an ordinary member of the Yadu dynasty, He appeared to react to the curse of the brāhmaṇas by giving up His earthly pastimes. Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot actually be cursed by anyone. Nārada Muni and the other sages who cursed the Yadu dynasty are eternal devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa and could hardly curse Him. Therefore, in giving up His pastimes and leaving the earth with the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kṛṣṇa demonstrated His internal potency and personal will, since no one can challenge the supreme potency of the Personality of Godhead.

ब्रह्मशापोपसंसृष्टे स्वकुले यादवर्षभ: ।
प्रेयसीं सर्वनेत्राणां तनुं स कथमत्यजत् ॥ २ ॥
brahma-śāpopasaṁsṛṣṭe
sva-kule yādavarṣabhaḥ
preyasīṁ sarva-netrāṇāṁ
tanuṁ sa katham atyajat
Synonyms
brahma-śāpa — by the curse of the brāhmaṇas; upasaṁsṛṣṭe — having been destroyed; sva-kule — His own family; yādava-ṛṣabhaḥ — the chief of the Yadus; preyasīm — most dear; sarva-netrāṇām — to all eyes; tanum — the body; saḥ — He; katham — how; atyajat — gave up.
Translation
After His own dynasty met destruction from the curse of the brāhmaṇas, how could the best of the Yadus give up His body, the dearmost object of all eyes?
Purport
In relation to this verse, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that the Personality of Godhead never gives up His spiritual body, which is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. The word katham therefore indicates “How is it possible?”, meaning it is not actually possible for Lord Kṛṣṇa to give up His eternal form, which is preyasīṁ sarva-netrāṇām, the most attractive object of pleasure for the eyes and all other senses.

प्रत्याक्रष्टुं नयनमबला यत्र लग्नं न शेकु:
कर्णाविष्टं न सरति ततो यत् सतामात्मलग्नम् ।
यच्छ्रीर्वाचां जनयति रतिं किं नु मानं कवीनां
द‍ृष्ट्वा जिष्णोर्युधि रथगतं यच्च तत्साम्यमीयु: ॥ ३ ॥
pratyākraṣṭuṁ nayanam abalā yatra lagnaṁ na śekuḥ
karṇāviṣṭaṁ na sarati tato yat satām ātma-lagnam
yac-chrīr vācāṁ janayati ratiṁ kiṁ nu mānaṁ kavīnāṁ
dṛṣṭvā jiṣṇor yudhi ratha-gataṁ yac ca tat-sāmyam īyuḥ
Synonyms
pratyākraṣṭum — to withdraw; nayanam — their eyes; abalāḥ — the women; yatra — in which; lagnam — attached; na śekuḥ — were not able; karṇa — the ears; āviṣṭam — having entered; na sarati — would not leave; tataḥ — thence; yat — which; satām — of the sages; ātma — in their hearts; lagnam — attached; yat — of which; śrīḥ — the beauty; vācām — of the words; janayati — generates; ratim — special pleasurable attraction; kim nu — what to speak of; mānam — the reputation; kavīnām — of the poets; dṛṣṭvā — seeing; jiṣṇoḥ — of Arjuna; yudhi — on the battlefield; ratha-gatam — on the chariot; yat — which; ca — and; tat-sāmyam — an equal status with Him; īyuḥ — they attained.
Translation
Once their eyes were fixed upon His transcendental form, women were unable to withdraw them, and once that form had entered the ears of the sages and become fixed in their hearts, it would never depart. What to speak of acquiring fame, the great poets who described the beauty of the Lord’s form would have their words invested with transcendentally pleasing attraction. And by seeing that form on Arjuna’s chariot, all the warriors on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained the liberation of gaining a spiritual body similar to the Lord’s.
Purport
Transcendental, liberated personalities such as the gopīs of Vṛndāvana and Rukmiṇī, the original goddess of fortune, were constantly meditating on the Lord’s spiritual body. Great liberated sages (satām), having heard about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body, could not take it out of their hearts. The Lord’s bodily beauty expanded the love and poetic output of great liberated poets, and simply by seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body, the warriors at Kurukṣetra achieved spiritual liberation with an eternal body similar to the Lord’s. Therefore it is impossible to imagine Lord Kṛṣṇa’s eternal form of bliss to be in any way material. Those who imagine that Lord Kṛṣṇa gave up His eternal form are certainly bewildered by the Lord’s illusory energy.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Having observed many disturbing signs in the sky, on the earth and in outer space, Lord Kṛṣṇa addressed the Yadus assembled in the Sudharmā council hall as follows.
Purport
According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the inauspicious sign in the sky was the appearance of a halo around the sun, on the earth there were small earthquakes, and in outer space there was an unnatural redness on the horizon. These and other, similar omens were impossible to counteract, because they were personally arranged by Lord Kṛṣṇa.

श्रीभगवानुवाच
एते घोरा महोत्पाता द्वार्वत्यां यमकेतव: ।
मुहूर्तमपि न स्थेयमत्र नो यदुपुङ्गवा: ॥ ५ ॥
śrī-bhagavān uvāca
ete ghorā mahotpātā
dvārvatyāṁ yama-ketavaḥ
muhūrtam api na stheyam
atra no yadu-puṅgavāḥ
Synonyms
śrī-bhagavān uvāca — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; ete — these; ghorāḥ — fearful; mahā — great; utpātāḥ — inauspicious omens; dvārvatyām — in Dvārakā; yama — of the king of death; ketavaḥ — the flags; muhūrtam — a moment; api — even; na stheyam — should not remain; atra — here; naḥ — we; yadu-puṅgavāḥ — O best of the Yadus.
Translation
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O leaders of the Yadu dynasty, please note all these terrible omens that have appeared in Dvārakā just like the flags of death. We should not remain here a moment longer.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has given a great amount of evidence from the Vedic literatures proving that the humanlike form of the Personality of Godhead and His holy name, abode, paraphernalia and associates are all eternal, spiritual manifestations without any tinge of material contamination. (See Appendix). In this regard the ācārya has further explained that because the living entities must suffer the reactions to their sinful activities, the Lord arranges for them to be punished during the Kali-yuga. In other words, it is not Lord Kṛṣṇa’s desire that conditioned souls be sinful and suffer, but since they are already sinful, the Lord creates an appropriate age during which they can experience the bitter fruits of irreligiosity.
Since Lord Kṛṣṇa personally establishes religious principles in His various appearances in this material world, at the end of Dvāpara-yuga religion on the earth was overwhelmingly powerful. All the significant demons had been killed; the great sages, saints and devotees had been greatly encouraged, enlightened and fortified; and there was little scope for irreligion. Had Lord Kṛṣṇa ascended to the spiritual sky in His spiritual body before the eyes of the world, it would have been very difficult for Kali-yuga to flourish. Lord Kṛṣṇa left the world in exactly that way during His appearance as Rāmacandra, and hundreds of thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of pious persons still discuss this wonderful pastime of the Lord. To pave the way for Kali-yuga, however, Lord Kṛṣṇa left this world in a way that puzzles those who are not His staunch devotees.
The eternal form of the Lord is described throughout Vedic literature, and His eternal form constitutes the highest understanding of the Absolute Truth according to all great ācāryas, including Śaṅkarācārya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Yet although Lord Kṛṣṇa’s eternal, spiritual form is a realized fact for advanced devotees, for those who are weak in Kṛṣṇa consciousness the inconceivable pastimes and plan of the Lord are sometimes hard to appreciate properly.

A beautiful smile graced His lotus face, locks of dark blue hair adorned His head, His lotus eyes were very attractive, and His shark-shaped earrings glittered. He wore a pair of silken garments, an ornamental belt, the sacred thread, bracelets and arm ornaments, along with a helmet, the Kaustubha jewel, necklaces, anklets and other royal emblems.

muṣalāvaśeṣāyaḥ-khaṇḍa-
kṛteṣur lubdhako jarā
mṛgāsyākāraṁ tac-caraṇaṁ
vivyādha mṛga-śaṅkayā
Synonyms
muṣala — from the iron club; avaśeṣa — remaining; ayaḥ — of iron; khaṇḍa — with the fragment; kṛta — who had made; iṣuḥ — his arrow; lubdhakaḥ — the hunter; jarā — named Jarā; mṛga — of a deer; āsya — of the face; ākāram — having the form; tat — His; caraṇam — lotus foot; vivyādha — pierced; mṛga-śaṅkayā — thinking it to be a deer.
Translation
Just then a hunter named Jarā, who had approached the place, mistook the Lord’s foot for a deer’s face. Thinking he had found his prey, Jarā pierced the foot with his arrow, which he had fashioned from the remaining iron fragment of Sāmba’s club.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the statement that the arrow “pierced the Lord’s foot” expresses the point of view of the hunter, who thought he had struck a deer. In fact the arrow merely touched the Lord’s lotus foot and did not pierce it, since the Lord’s limbs are composed of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Otherwise, in the description of the next verse (that the hunter became fearful and fell down with his head upon the Lord’s feet), Śukadeva Gosvāmī would have stated that he extracted his arrow from the Lord’s foot.

Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that the fratricidal battle of the Yadu dynasty and the hunter’s attack upon Lord Kṛṣṇa are clearly activities of the Lord’s internal potency for the purpose of fulfilling the Lord’s pastime desires. According to the evidence, the quarrel among the members of the Yadu dynasty occurred at sunset; then the Lord sat down on the bank of the Sarasvatī River. It is stated that a hunter then arrived with the intention of killing a deer, but it is highly unlikely — when more than 560 million warriors had just been killed in a great uproarious battle and the place had been flooded with blood and strewn with corpses — that a simple hunter would somehow come along trying to kill a deer. Since deer are by nature fearful and timid, how could any deer possibly be on the scene of such a huge battle, and how could a hunter calmly go about his business in the midst of such carnage? Therefore, the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s own disappearance from this earth were not material historical events; they were instead a display of the Lord’s internal potency for the purpose of winding up His manifest pastimes on earth.

Translation
Neither Brahmā nor his sons, headed by Rudra, nor any of the great sages who are masters of the Vedic mantras can understand the function of Your mystic power. Because Your illusory potency has covered their sight, they remain ignorant of how Your mystic power works. Therefore, what can I, such a low-born person, possibly say?
