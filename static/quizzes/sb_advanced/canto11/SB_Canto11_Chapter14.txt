CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Lord Kṛṣṇa Explains the Yoga System to Śrī Uddhava
In this chapter, Kṛṣṇa explains that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the most excellent method of spiritual practice. He also speaks about the process of meditation.
Śrī Uddhava wanted to know which process of spiritual advancement is the best. He also desired to hear about the superexcellence of devotional service free from ulterior motives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied to him that the original process of religion revealed in the Vedas had become lost during the time of annihilation. At the beginning of the new creation, therefore, the Supreme Lord spoke it again to Brahmā. Brahmā repeated it to Manu, Manu spoke it to the sages headed by Bhṛgu Muni, and these sages in turn instructed this eternal religion to the demigods and demons. Because of the living entities’ multitude of diverse desires, this system of religion was elaborately explained in different ways. Thus different philosophies arose, including various atheistic doctrines. Because the living entity, bewildered by illusion, is incapable of ascertaining his eternal benefit, he mistakenly identifies ordinary vows of penance, austerity, etc., to be the topmost spiritual practice. But the only true means of achieving happiness is to meditate on offering everything to the Supreme Lord. In this way one becomes free from all desires for selfish gratification through enjoyment of mundane sense objects, and he becomes released from all hankering for either enjoyment or liberation.
The Lord then proceeded to describe the superior process of devotional service, which destroys countless sinful reactions and produces many symptoms of spiritual happiness, such as the standing of the hairs on end. Pure devotion, having the power to purify the heart, enables one to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because the devotee is very dear to the Lord and is always close to Him, he is able in turn to purify the entire universe. By virtue of his unflinching devotion to the Lord, the devotee can never be completely diverted by the objects of sense enjoyment, even if he is not able to gain control over his senses in the beginning. One desiring to attain the perfection of life is advised to give up all material processes of elevation as well as the association of women. He should then merge his mind constantly in thought of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Finally, the Lord instructed Śrī Uddhava about the true object of meditation.

śrī-uddhava uvāca

Synonyms
śrī-uddhavaḥ uvāca — Śrī Uddhava said; vadanti — they speak; kṛṣṇa — my dear Kṛṣṇa; śreyāṁsi — processes for advancement in life; bahūni — many; brahma-vādinaḥ — the learned sages who have explained the Vedic literature; teṣām — of all such processes; vikalpa — of varieties of perception; prādhānyam — supremacy; uta — or; aho — indeed; eka — of one; mukhyatā — being most important.
Translation
Śrī Uddhava said: My dear Kṛṣṇa, the learned sages who explain Vedic literature recommend various processes for perfecting one’s life. Considering these varieties of viewpoint, my Lord, please tell me whether all these processes are equally important, or whether one of them is supreme.
Purport
In order to clearly establish the exalted position of bhakti-yoga, or pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Śrī Uddhava requests Lord Kṛṣṇa to identify the supreme among all processes of self-realization. Not all Vedic processes lead directly to the ultimate goal, pure love of God; some only gradually elevate the consciousness of the living entity. For the purpose of giving a general outline of the process of self-realization, sages may discuss the various methods of elevation. But when the time comes to ascertain the most perfect process, the secondary methods must be cleared from the path.

भवतोदाहृत: स्वामिन् भक्तियोगोऽनपेक्षित: ।

bhavatodāhṛtaḥ svāmin

nirasya sarvataḥ saṅgaṁ

Synonyms
bhavatā — by You; udāhṛtaḥ — clearly stated; svāmin — O my Lord; bhakti-yogaḥ — devotional service; anapekṣitaḥ — without material desires; nirasya — removing; sarvataḥ — in all respects; saṅgam — material association; yena — by which (devotional service); tvayi — in Your Lordship; āviśet — may enter; manaḥ — the mind.
Translation
My dear Lord, You have clearly explained the process of unalloyed devotional service, by which a devotee removes all material association from his life, enabling him to fix his mind on You.
Purport
It is now clearly established that pure devotional service is the supreme process for fixing the mind in the Supreme Truth, Lord Kṛṣṇa. The next point to be clarified is this: Can everyone practice this process, or is it limited to an elite class of transcendentalists? In discussing the relative advantages of different spiritual processes, one must immediately ascertain the goal of spiritual life and then isolate the process that actually awards this goal. Processes must be defined in terms of primary and secondary functions. A method that gives one the highest perfection is primary, whereas processes that merely assist or enhance the primary function are considered secondary. The mind is most flickering and unsteady; therefore by clear intelligence one must fix oneself in a progressive mode of life, and thus one can achieve the Absolute Truth in this lifetime. This is the sober purpose of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s conversation with Śrī Uddhava.

श्रीभगवानुवाच
कालेन नष्टा प्रलये वाणीयं वेदसंज्ञिता ।
मयादौ ब्रह्मणे प्रोक्ता धर्मो यस्यां मदात्मक: ॥ ३ ॥
śrī-bhagavān uvāca
kālena naṣṭā pralaye
vāṇīyaṁ veda-saṁjñitā
mayādau brahmaṇe proktā
dharmo yasyāṁ mad-ātmakaḥ
Synonyms
śrī-bhagavān uvāca — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; kālena — by the influence of time; naṣṭā — lost; pralaye — at the time of annihilation; vāṇī — message; iyam — this; veda-saṁjñitā — consisting of the Vedas; mayā — by Me; ādau — at the time of creation; brahmaṇe — unto Lord Brahmā; proktā — spoken; dharmaḥ — religious principles; yasyām — in which; mat-ātmakaḥ — identical with Me.
Translation
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: By the influence of time, the transcendental sound of Vedic knowledge was lost at the time of annihilation. Therefore, when the subsequent creation took place, I spoke the Vedic knowledge to Brahmā because I Myself am the religious principles enunciated in the Vedas.
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa explains to Uddhava that although many processes and concepts of spiritual realization are described in the Vedas, the Vedas ultimately recommend devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure, and His devotees directly enter into the Lord’s hlādinī, or pleasure-giving, potency. Somehow or other one must fix one’s mind in Lord Kṛṣṇa, and that is not possible without devotional service. One who has not developed his attraction to Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot restrain the senses from inferior engagements. Since other Vedic processes do not actually award Lord Kṛṣṇa to the practitioner, they cannot offer the highest benefit in life. The transcendental sound of the Vedas is itself the highest evidence, but one whose senses and mind are entangled in sense gratification and mental speculation, and whose heart is therefore covered by material dust, cannot directly receive the transcendental Vedic message. Thus one cannot appreciate the exalted position of devotional service to the Lord.

tena proktā sva-putrāya
manave pūrva-jāya sā
tato bhṛgv-ādayo ’gṛhṇan
sapta brahma-maharṣayaḥ
Synonyms
tena — by Brahmā; proktā — spoken; sva-putrāya — to his son; manave — to Manu; pūrva-jāya — the oldest; sā — that Vedic knowledge; tataḥ — from Manu; bhṛgu-ādayaḥ — those headed by Bhṛgu Muni; agṛhṇan — accepted; sapta — seven; brahma — in Vedic literature; mahā-ṛṣayaḥ — most learned sages.
Translation
Lord Brahmā spoke this Vedic knowledge to his eldest son, Manu, and the seven great sages headed by Bhṛgu Muni then accepted the same knowledge from Manu.
Purport
Everyone engages in a certain way of life based on one’s own nature and propensities. Bhakti-yoga is the natural activity of one whose nature is completely purified by association with the Supreme Lord. Other processes are meant for those whose nature is still affected by the material modes, and thus such processes, along with their results, are themselves also materially contaminated. Devotional service to the Lord, however, is a pure spiritual process, and by executing it with a pure consciousness one comes directly in touch with the Personality of Godhead, who describes Himself in Bhagavad-gītā (9.2) as pavitram idam uttamam, the supreme pure. The system of paramparā, or disciplic succession, is illustrated in this and the previous verse. The spiritual masters in Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement are part of such a disciplic succession, and through them the same Vedic knowledge spoken by Brahmā to Manu is still available.

Translation
From the forefathers headed by Bhṛgu Muni and other sons of Brahmā appeared many children and descendants, who assumed different forms as demigods, demons, human beings, Guhyakas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas, Kindevas, Kinnaras, Nāgas, Kimpuruṣas, and so on. All of the many universal species, along with their respective leaders, appeared with different natures and desires generated from the three modes of material nature. Therefore, because of the different characteristics of the living entities within the universe, there are a great many Vedic rituals, mantras and rewards.
Purport
If one is curious why Vedic literatures recommend so many different methods of worship and advancement, the answer is given here. Bhṛgu, Marīci, Atri, Aṅgirā, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu are the seven great brāhmaṇa sages and forefathers of this universe. The Kindevas are a race of human beings who are, like the demigods, completely free from fatigue, sweat and body odor. Seeing them, one may thus ask, kiṁ devāḥ: “Are they demigods?” Actually, they are human beings living on another planet within the universe. The Kinnaras are so called because they are kiñcin narāḥ, or “a little like human beings.” The Kinnaras have either a human head or human body (but not both) combined with a nonhuman form. The Kimpuruṣas are so called because they resemble human beings and thus prompt the question kiṁ puruṣāḥ: “Are these human beings?” Actually, they are a race of monkeys who are almost like human beings.
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that this verse describes the varieties of forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The different Vedic mantras and rituals are especially meant for the different species of intelligent beings throughout the universe; but this proliferation of Vedic formulas indicates only the variety of material illusion and not a variety of ultimate purpose. The ultimate purpose of the many Vedic injunctions is one — to know and love the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord Himself is emphatically explaining this to Śrī Uddhava.

evaṁ prakṛti-vaicitryād
bhidyante matayo nṛṇām
pāramparyeṇa keṣāñcit
pāṣaṇḍa-matayo ’pare
Synonyms
evam — thus; prakṛti — of nature or desires; vaicitryāt — due to the great variety; bhidyante — are divided; matayaḥ — philosophies of life; nṛṇām — among human beings; pāramparyeṇa — by tradition or disciplic succession; keṣāñcit — among some people; pāṣaṇḍa — atheistic; matayaḥ — philosophies; apare — others.
Translation
Thus, due to the great variety of desires and natures among human beings, there are many different theistic philosophies of life, which are handed down through tradition, custom and disciplic succession. There are other teachers who directly support atheistic viewpoints.
Purport
The word keṣāñcit refers to those persons in various parts of the world who are ignorant of the Vedic conclusion and thus concoct many unauthorized and ultimately fruitless philosophies of life. Pāṣaṇḍa-matayaḥ refers to those who directly oppose the Vedic conclusion. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has given a most interesting example, as follows. The water of the Ganges is always pure and very sweet. On the banks of that great river, however, there are several types of poisonous trees whose roots drink up the Ganges water from the soil and use it to produce poisonous fruits. Similarly, those who are atheistic or demoniac utilize their association with Vedic knowledge to produce the poisonous fruits of atheistic or materialistic philosophy.

man-māyā-mohita-dhiyaḥ

Synonyms
mat-māyā — by My illusory potency; mohita — bewildered; dhiyaḥ — those whose intelligence; puruṣāḥ — people; puruṣa-ṛṣabha — O best among men; śreyaḥ — what is good for people; vadanti — they speak; aneka-antam — in innumerable ways; yathā-karma — according to their own activities; yathā-ruci — according to what pleases them.
Translation
O best among men, the intelligence of human beings is bewildered by My illusory potency, and thus, according to their own activities and whims, they speak in innumerable ways about what is actually good for people.
Purport
Unlike the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual living entity is not omniscient, therefore his activities and pleasures do not represent the whole truth. According to one’s individual way of doing things (yathā-karma) and one’s personal preference (yathā-ruci), one speaks to others about what is good for them. Everyone thinks, “What is good for me is good for everyone.” Actually, the best thing for everyone is to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus realize one’s eternal nature of bliss and knowledge. Without knowledge of the Absolute Truth, many so-called learned people are whimsically advising other whimsical people who also lack perfect knowledge of the actual goal of life.

Translation
Some say that people will be happy by performing pious religious activities. Others say that happiness is attained through fame, sense gratification, truthfulness, self-control, peace, self-interest, political influence, opulence, renunciation, consumption, sacrifice, penance, charity, vows, regulated duties or strict disciplinary regulation. Each process has its proponents.
Purport
Dharmam eke refers to those atheistic philosophers called karma-mīmāṁsakas, who state that one should not waste time worrying about a kingdom of God that no one has ever seen and from which no one has ever returned; rather, one should expertly utilize the laws of karma, performing fruitive activities in such a way that one will always be well situated. Concerning fame, it is said that as long as the fame of a human being is sung in the pious planets, he may live for thousands of years in material heaven. Kāmam refers to Vedic texts like the Kāma-sūtra as well as millions of modern books that advise one about sex pleasure. Some people state that the highest virtue in life is honesty; others say it is self-control, peace of mind and so on. Each viewpoint has proponents and “scriptures.” Others say that law, order and morality are the highest good, whereas still others propose political influence as the real self-interest of human beings. Some state that one should give away one’s material possessions to the needy; others state that one should try to enjoy this life as far as possible; and others recommend daily rituals, disciplinary vows, penances, and so on.

ādy-anta-vanta evaiṣāṁ
lokāḥ karma-vinirmitāḥ

Synonyms
ādi-anta-vantaḥ — possessing a beginning and end; eva — undoubtedly; eṣām — of them (the materialistic); lokāḥ — achieved destinations; karma — by one’s material work; vinirmitāḥ — produced; duḥkha — misery; udarkāḥ — bringing as the future result; tamaḥ — ignorance; niṣṭhāḥ — situated in; kṣudrāḥ — meager; mandāḥ — wretched; śucā — with lamentation; arpitāḥ — filled.
Translation
All the persons I have just mentioned obtain temporary fruits from their material work. Indeed, the meager and miserable situations they achieve bring future unhappiness and are based on ignorance. Even while enjoying the fruits of their work, such persons are filled with lamentation.
Purport
Those who have grasped temporary material things, mistaking them to be ultimate reality, are not considered very intelligent by anyone except themselves. Such foolish persons are always in anxiety because by the laws of nature the very fruits of their work are constantly being transformed in ways neither desired nor expected. The performer of Vedic rituals can elevate himself to heavenly planets, whereas one who is atheistic has the privilege of transferring himself to hell. The entire panorama of material existence is actually uninteresting and dull (mandāḥ). One can make no real progress within the material world; therefore one should take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and prepare oneself to go back home, back to Godhead.

Synonyms
mayi — in Me; arpita — fixed; ātmanaḥ — of one whose consciousness; sabhya — O learned Uddhava; nirapekṣasya — of one bereft of material desires; sarvataḥ — in all respects; mayā — with Me; ātmanā — with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or with one’s own spiritual body; sukham — happiness; yat tat — such; kutaḥ — how; syāt — could it be; viṣaya — in material sense gratification; ātmanām — of those who are attached.
Translation
O learned Uddhava, those who fix their consciousness on Me, giving up all material desires, share with Me a happiness that cannot possibly be experienced by those engaged in sense gratification.
Purport
The actual purport of Vedic knowledge is explained in this verse. The word viṣayātmanām includes those who are cultivating material peace of mind, self-control and speculative philosophy. But even if such persons rise to the platform of sattva-guṇa, the mode of goodness, they do not attain perfection, because sattva-guṇa, being material, is also part and parcel of māyā, or illusion. As stated by Śrī Nārada Muni:
kiṁ vā yogena sāṅkhyena
nyāsa-svādhyāyayor api
kiṁ vā śreyobhir anyaiś ca
na yatrātma-prado hariḥ
“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not inclined to award Himself even to one who executes the yoga system, speculative philosophy, the renounced order of life or Vedic studies. Indeed, no so-called materially auspicious process can induce the Lord to reveal Himself.” (Bhāg. 4.31.12) According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, one enjoys the happiness spoken of in this verse while associating, in one’s own spiritual body, with the supreme transcendental form of the Lord. The Lord’s transcendental form is filled with infinite, wonderful qualities, and the happiness of being with the Lord is unlimited. Unfortunately, materialistic people cannot possibly imagine such happiness, since they are not at all inclined to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Synonyms
akiñcanasya — of one who does not desire anything; dāntasya — whose senses are controlled; śāntasya — peaceful; sama-cetasaḥ — whose consciousness is equal everywhere; mayā — with Me; santuṣṭa — completely satisfied; manasaḥ — whose mind; sarvāḥ — all; sukha-mayāḥ — full of happiness; diśaḥ — directions.
Translation
One who does not desire anything within this world, who has achieved peace by controlling his senses, whose consciousness is equal in all conditions and whose mind is completely satisfied in Me finds only happiness wherever he goes.
Purport
A devotee who is always meditating upon Lord Kṛṣṇa experiences transcendental sound, touch, form, flavor and aroma in the pastimes of the Lord. These sublime perceptions are certainly due to the causeless mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa upon one whose mind and senses are completely satisfied in Him. Such a person finds only happiness wherever he goes. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the example that when a very wealthy man travels all over the world, at every place he stays he always enjoys the same luxurious standard of comfort. Similarly, one who has developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness is never separated from happiness, because Lord Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading. The word kiñcana indicates the so-called enjoyable things of this world. One who is akiñcana has correctly understood that material sense gratification is simply the glare of illusion, and therefore such a person is dāntasya, or self-controlled, śāntasya, or peaceful, and mayā santuṣṭa-manasaḥ, or completely satisfied with his transcendental experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

na — not; pārameṣṭhyam — the position or abode of Lord Brahmā; na — never; mahā-indra-dhiṣṇyam — the position of Lord Indra; na — neither; sārvabhaumam — empire on the earth; na — nor; rasa-ādhipatyam — sovereignty in the lower planetary systems; na — never; yoga-siddhīḥ — the eightfold yoga perfections; apunaḥ-bhavam — liberation; vā — nor; mayi — in Me; arpita — fixed; ātmā — consciousness; icchati — he desires; mat — Me; vinā — without; anyat — anything else.
Translation
One who has fixed his consciousness on Me desires neither the position or abode of Lord Brahmā or Lord Indra, nor an empire on the earth, nor sovereignty in the lower planetary systems, nor the eightfold perfection of yoga, nor liberation from birth and death. Such a person desires Me alone.
Purport
The position of the akiñcana pure devotee is described in this verse. Śrī Priyavrata Mahārāja is an example of a great devotee who was not interested in universal sovereignty because his love was completely absorbed in the lotus feet of the Lord. Even the greatest material enjoyment appears most insignificant and useless to a pure devotee of the Lord.

na tathā me priyatama

Synonyms
na — not; tathā — in the same way; me — to Me; priya-tamaḥ — most dear; ātma-yoniḥ — Lord Brahmā, who is born from My body; na — nor; śaṅkaraḥ — Lord Śiva; na — nor; ca — also; saṅkarṣaṇaḥ — My direct expansion Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa; na — nor; śrīḥ — the goddess of fortune; na — nor; eva — certainly; ātmā — My own self as the Deity; ca — also; yathā — as much as; bhavān — you.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, neither Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, the goddess of fortune nor indeed My own self are as dear to Me as you are.
Purport
The Lord has described in the previous verses the unalloyed love of His pure devotees for Him, and now the Lord describes His love for His devotees. Ātma-yoni means Lord Brahmā, who is born directly from the Lord’s body. Lord Śiva always gives great pleasure to Lord Kṛṣṇa by his constant meditation upon Him, and Saṅkarṣaṇa, or Balarāma, is the Lord’s brother in kṛṣṇa-līlā. The goddess of fortune is the Lord’s wife, and the word ātmā here indicates the Lord’s own self as the Deity. None of these personalities — even the Lord’s own self — are as dear to Him as His pure devotee Uddhava, an akiñcana devotee of the Lord. Śrīla Madhvācārya cites from Vedic literature the example that a gentleman sometimes neglects his own interest and that of his children to give charity to a poor beggar. Similarly, the Lord gives preference to a helpless devotee who depends completely on His mercy. The only way to obtain the Lord’s mercy is through His causeless love, and the Lord is most lovingly inclined toward those devotees who are most dependent on Him, just as ordinary mothers and fathers worry more about their helpless children than about those who are self-sufficient. Thus even if one lacks any material qualification, one should simply depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without any other interest, and surely one will achieve the highest perfection of life.

nirapekṣaṁ muniṁ śāntaṁ

Synonyms
nirapekṣam — without personal desire; munim — always thinking of assisting Me in My pastimes; śāntam — peaceful; nirvairam — not inimical to anyone; sama-darśanam — equal consciousness everywhere; anuvrajāmi — follow; aham — I; nityam — always; pūyeya — I may be purified (I will purify the universe within Me); iti — thus; aṅghri — of the lotus feet; reṇubhiḥ — by the dust.
Translation
With the dust of My devotees’ lotus feet I desire to purify the material worlds, which are situated within Me. Thus, I always follow the footsteps of My pure devotees, who are free from all personal desire, rapt in thought of My pastimes, peaceful, without any feelings of enmity, and of equal disposition everywhere.
Purport
Just as the devotees always follow the footsteps of Lord Kṛṣṇa, similarly Lord Kṛṣṇa, being a devotee of His devotees, follows the footsteps of His devotees. A pure servitor of the Lord is always meditating on the pastimes of the Lord and considering how to assist the Lord in His mission. All the material universes are situated in Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s body, as demonstrated to Arjuna, mother Yaśodā and others. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore there is no question of impurity in the Lord. Still, the Lord desires to purify the universes situated within Him by taking the dust of the lotus feet of His pure devotees. Without the dust of the lotus feet of the devotees, it is not possible to engage in pure devotional service, without which one cannot directly experience transcendental bliss. Lord Kṛṣṇa thought, “I have established this strict rule that one can enjoy My transcendental bliss only through devotional service obtained from the dust of the lotus feet of My devotees. Since I also desire to experience My own bliss, I will observe the standard procedure and accept the dust of My devotees’ feet.” Śrīla Madhvācārya points out that Lord Kṛṣṇa follows the footsteps of His devotees in order to purify them. As the Lord walks along behind His pure devotees, the wind blows the dust of the Lord’s feet in the front of His devotees, who then become purified by contact with such transcendental dust. One should not foolishly look for material logic in these transcendental pastimes of the Lord. It is simply a question of love between the Lord and His devotees.

Synonyms
niṣkiñcanāḥ — without any desire for sense gratification; mayi — in Me, the Supreme Lord; anurakta-cetasaḥ — mind constantly attached; śāntāḥ — peaceful; mahāntaḥ — great souls without false ego; akhila — to all; jīva — living entities; vatsalāḥ — affectionate well-wishers; kāmaiḥ — by opportunities for sense gratification; anālabdha — untouched and unaffected; dhiyaḥ — whose consciousness; juṣanti — experience; te — they; yat — which; nairapekṣyam — achieved only by complete detachment; na viduḥ — they do not know; sukham — happiness; mama — My.
Translation
Those who are without any desire for personal gratification, whose minds are always attached to Me, who are peaceful, without false ego and merciful to all living entities, and whose consciousness is never affected by opportunities for sense gratification — such persons enjoy in Me a happiness that cannot be known or achieved by those lacking such detachment from the material world.
Purport
The pure devotees always experience transcendental bliss in their service to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of pleasure; thus they are completely detached from material pleasure and do not desire even liberation. Since all others have some personal desire, they cannot experience such happiness. Pure devotees always desire to give Kṛṣṇa conscious happiness to all others, and therefore they are called mahāntaḥ, or great souls. In the course of a devotee’s service, many opportunities for sense gratification arise, but a pure devotee is not tempted or attracted and does not fall down from his exalted transcendental position.

bādhyamāno ’pi mad-bhakto

prāyaḥ pragalbhayā bhaktyā
viṣayair nābhibhūyate
Synonyms
bādhyamānaḥ — being harassed; api — even though; mat-bhaktaḥ — My devotee; viṣayaiḥ — by the sense objects; ajita — without having conquered; indriyaḥ — the senses; prāyaḥ — generally; pragalbhayā — effective and strong; bhaktyā — by devotion; viṣayaiḥ — by sense gratification; na — not; abhibhūyate — is defeated.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, if My devotee has not fully conquered his senses, he may be harassed by material desires, but because of his unflinching devotion for Me, he will not be defeated by sense gratification.
Purport
Abhibhūyate indicates falling down into the material world and being defeated by māyā. But even though one’s senses are not fully conquered, one who has unflinching devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa does not run the risk of being separated from Him. The words pragalbhayā bhaktyā indicate a person who has great devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa, and not one who desires to commit sinful activities and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to avoid the reaction. Because of previous bad habits and immaturity, even a sincere devotee may be harassed by lingering attraction to the bodily concept of life; but his unflinching devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa will act. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the following two examples. A great warrior may be struck by the weapon of his enemy, but because of his courage and strength he is not killed or defeated. He accepts the blow and goes on to victory. Similarly, one may contract a serious disease, but if he takes the proper medicine he is quickly cured.
If those who follow the impersonal system of speculation and austerity deviate even slightly from their path, they fall down. A devotee, however, even though immature, never falls from the path of devotional service. Even if he displays occasional weakness, he is still considered a devotee if his devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa is very strong. As the Lord states in Bhagavad-gītā (9.30):
api cet su-durācāro
bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
“Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.”

Synonyms
yathā — just as; agniḥ — fire; su-samṛddha — blazing; arciḥ — whose flames; karoti — turns; edhāṁsi — firewood; bhasma-sāt — into ashes; tathā — similarly; mat-viṣayā — with Me as the object; bhaktiḥ — devotion; uddhava — O Uddhava; enāṁsi — sins; kṛtsnaśaḥ — completely.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, just as a blazing fire turns firewood into ashes, similarly, devotion unto Me completely burns to ashes sins committed by My devotees.
Purport
One should carefully note that the Lord refers to devotion that is like a blazing fire. To commit sinful activity on the strength of chanting the holy name is the greatest offense, and the devotion of one who commits this offense cannot be compared to a blazing fire of love for Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the previous verse, a sincere loving devotee, because of immaturity or previous bad habits, may be disturbed by his senses even though he has accepted Lord Kṛṣṇa as the only goal in his life. But if even by chance the devotee accidentally falls down without premeditation or indifference, the Lord immediately burns to ashes his sinful reactions, just as a blazing fire immediately consumes an insignificant piece of wood. Lord Kṛṣṇa is glorious, and one who takes exclusive shelter of the Lord receives the unique benefits of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

na — not; sādhayati — brings under control; mām — Me; yogaḥ — the yoga system; na — nor; sāṅkhyam — the system of Sāṅkhya philosophy; dharmaḥ — pious activities within the varṇāśrama system; uddhava — My dear Uddhava; na — not; svādhyāyaḥ — Vedic study; tapaḥ — austerity; tyāgaḥ — renunciation; yathā — as; bhaktiḥ — devotional service; mama — unto Me; ūrjitā — strongly developed.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, the unalloyed devotional service rendered to Me by My devotees brings Me under their control. I cannot be thus controlled by those engaged in mystic yoga, Sāṅkhya philosophy, pious work, Vedic study, austerity or renunciation.
Purport
One may make Kṛṣṇa the goal of mystic yoga, Sāṅkhya philosophy, etc.; yet such activities do not please the Lord as much as direct loving service, which one practices by hearing and chanting about the Lord and executing His mission. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states, jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam: a devotee should simply depend on Kṛṣṇa and should not unnecessarily complicate his loving service with tendencies toward fruitive work or mental speculation. The residents of Vṛndāvana simply depend on Lord Kṛṣṇa. When the great serpent Aghāsura appeared in the precincts of Vraja, the cowherd boys, completely confident in their friendship with Lord Kṛṣṇa, fearlessly marched into the serpent’s gigantic mouth. Such pure love for Kṛṣṇa brings the Lord under the control of the devotee.

bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ

Synonyms
bhaktyā — by devotional service; aham — I; ekayā — unalloyed; grāhyaḥ — am to be obtained; śraddhayā — by faith; ātmā — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; priyaḥ — the object of love; satām — of the devotees; bhaktiḥ — pure devotional service; punāti — purifies; mat-niṣṭhā — fixing Me as the only goal; śva-pākān — dog-eaters; api — even; sambhavāt — from the contamination of low birth.
Translation
Only by practicing unalloyed devotional service with full faith in Me can one obtain Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am naturally dear to My devotees, who take Me as the only goal of their loving service. By engaging in such pure devotional service, even the dog-eaters can purify themselves from the contamination of their low birth.
Purport
Sambhavāt indicates jāti-doṣāt, or the pollution of low birth. Jāti-doṣa does not refer to mundane social, economic or professional status, but rather to one’s degree of spiritual enlightenment. All around the world, many people are born into rich and powerful families, but they often acquire abominable habits that are part of their so-called family tradition. However, even unfortunate persons who are taught from birth to engage in sinful activities can at once be purified by the potency of pure devotional service. Such service must have Lord Kṛṣṇa as the only goal (man-niṣṭhā), must be rendered with full faith (śraddhayā), and must be unalloyed, or without any selfish motivation (ekayā).

dharmaḥ satya-dayopeto

Synonyms
dharmaḥ — religious principles; satya — with truthfulness; dayā — and mercy; upetaḥ — endowed; vidyā — knowledge; vā — or; tapasā — with austerity; anvitā — endowed; mat-bhaktyā — devotional service to Me; apetam — bereft of; ātmānam — consciousness; na — not; samyak — completely; prapunāti — purifies; hi — certainly.
Translation
Neither religious activities endowed with honesty and mercy nor knowledge obtained with great penance can completely purify one’s consciousness if they are bereft of loving service to Me.
Purport
Although pious religious work, truthfulness, mercy, penances and knowledge partially purify one’s existence, they do not take out the root of material desires. Thus the same desires will reappear at a later time. After an extensive program of material gratification, one becomes eager to perform austerities, acquire knowledge, perform selfless work and in general purify one’s existence. After sufficient piety and purification, however, one again becomes eager for material enjoyment. When clearing an agricultural field one must uproot the unwanted plants, otherwise with the coming of rain everything will grow back as it was. Pure devotional service to the Lord uproots one’s material desires, so that there is no danger of relapsing into a degraded life of material gratification. In the eternal kingdom of God, loving reciprocation between the Lord and His devotees is manifest. One who has not come to this stage of enlightenment must remain on the material platform, which is always full of discrepancies and contradictions. Thus everything is incomplete and imperfect without loving service to the Lord.

kathaṁ vinā roma-harṣaṁ

Synonyms
katham — how; vinā — without; roma-harṣam — standing of the hairs on end; dravatā — melted; cetasā — heart; vinā — without; vinā — without; ānanda — of bliss; aśru-kalayā — the flowing of tears; śudhyet — can be purified; bhaktyā — loving service; vinā — without; āśayaḥ — the consciousness.
Translation
If one’s hairs do not stand on end, how can the heart melt? And if the heart does not melt, how can tears of love flow from the eyes? If one does not cry in spiritual happiness, how can one render loving service to the Lord? And without such service, how can the consciousness be purified?
Purport
Loving service to the Lord is the only process that can completely purify one’s consciousness; such service produces waves of ecstatic love that completely cleanse the soul. As mentioned earlier by Lord Kṛṣṇa to Śrī Uddhava, other processes such as self-control, pious activities, mystic yoga, penances, etc., certainly purify the mind, as stated in many authorized literatures. Such processes, however, do not completely remove the desire to perform forbidden activities. But pure devotional service rendered in love of Godhead is so powerful that it burns to ashes any obstacle encountered on the path of progress. The Lord has stated in this chapter that loving service to Him is a blazing fire that burns to ashes all impediments. In contrast, the small fires of mental speculation or mystic yoga can be extinguished by sinful desires at any moment. Thus, by hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam one should ignite the blazing fire of loving service to the Lord and burn to ashes the network of material illusion.

Translation
A devotee whose speech is sometimes choked up, whose heart melts, who cries continually and sometimes laughs, who feels ashamed and cries out loudly and then dances — a devotee thus fixed in loving service to Me purifies the entire universe.
Purport
Vāg gadgadā refers to a highly emotional state in which the throat is choked up and one cannot express oneself. Vilajjaḥ indicates that a devotee sometimes feels embarrassment due to bodily functions and memories of past sinful activities. In this condition, a devotee loudly cries out the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and sometimes dances in ecstasy. As stated here, such a devotee purifies the three worlds.
By melting of the heart, one becomes very steady in spiritual life. Normally, one whose heart easily melts is thought to be unsteady; but because Lord Kṛṣṇa is the stable foundation of all existence, one whose heart melts in love of Kṛṣṇa becomes most stable and cannot be disturbed by opposing arguments, bodily suffering, mental problems, supernatural disasters or the interference of envious persons. Because such a devotee is fixed in loving service to the Lord, he becomes the very heart of the Personality of Godhead.

Synonyms
yathā — just as; agninā — by fire; hema — gold; malam — impurities; jahāti — gives up; dhmātam — smelted; punaḥ — again; svam — its own; bhajate — enters; ca — also; rūpam — form; ātmā — the spirit soul or consciousness; ca — also; karma — of fruitive activities; anuśayam — the resultant contamination; vidhūya — removing; mat-bhakti-yogena — by loving service to Me; bhajati — worships; atho — thus; mām — Me.
Translation
Just as gold, when smelted in fire, gives up its impurities and returns to its pure brilliant state, similarly, the spirit soul, absorbed in the fire of bhakti-yoga, is purified of all contamination caused by previous fruitive activities and returns to its original position of serving Me in the spiritual world.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, this verse indicates that the devotee goes back home, back to Godhead, and there worships Lord Kṛṣṇa in his original spiritual body, which is compared to the original pure form of smelted gold. Gold alloyed with inferior metals cannot be purified by water and soap; similarly, the heart’s impurities cannot be removed by superficial processes. Only the fire of love of Godhead can cleanse one’s soul and send one back home, back to Godhead, to engage in eternal loving service to the Lord.

mat-puṇya-gāthā-śravaṇābhidhānaiḥ
tathā tathā paśyati vastu sūkṣmaṁ

Synonyms
yathā yathā — as much as; ātmā — the spirit soul, the conscious entity; parimṛjyate — is cleansed of material contamination; asau — he; mat-puṇya-gāthā — the pious narrations of My glories; śravaṇa — by hearing; abhidhānaiḥ — and by chanting; tathā tathā — exactly in that proportion; paśyati — he sees; vastu — the Absolute Truth; sūkṣmam — subtle, being nonmaterial; cakṣuḥ — the eye; yathā — just as; eva — certainly; añjana — with medicinal ointment; samprayuktam — treated.
Translation
When a diseased eye is treated with medicinal ointment it gradually recovers its power to see. Similarly, as a conscious living entity cleanses himself of material contamination by hearing and chanting the pious narrations of My glories, he regains his ability to see Me, the Absolute Truth, in My subtle spiritual form.
Purport
The Lord is called sūkṣmam because He is pure spiritual consciousness, without any tinge of material energy. If one chants and hears the holy name and glories of Kṛṣṇa with great sincerity, there is immediately a transcendental effect. We can immediately see the spiritual world and pastimes of the Lord if we fully surrender to the process mentioned here. A blind person feels perpetual gratitude to a doctor who restores his sight. Similarly, we sing cakṣu-dāna dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei: the bona fide spiritual master, the representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa, restores our spiritual sight, and thus he is our eternal lord and master.

Synonyms
viṣayān — objects of sense gratification; dhyāyataḥ — of one who is meditating on; cittam — the consciousness; viṣayeṣu — in the objects of gratification; viṣajjate — becomes attached; mām — Me; anusmarataḥ — of one remembering constantly; cittam — the consciousness; mayi — in Me; eva — certainly; pravilīyate — is absorbed.
Translation
The mind of one meditating upon the objects of sense gratification is certainly entangled in such objects, but if one constantly remembers Me, then the mind is absorbed in Me.
Purport
One should not think that one can attain complete transcendental knowledge of Kṛṣṇa by mechanically engaging in worship of the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa states here that one must endeavor constantly to keep the Lord within one’s mind. Anusmarataḥ, or constant remembrance, is possible for one who always chants and hears the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is therefore stated, śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam: the process of devotional service begins with hearing (śravaṇam) and chanting (kīrtanam), from which remembrance (smaraṇam) develops. One who constantly thinks of the objects of material gratification becomes attached to them; similarly, one who constantly keeps Lord Kṛṣṇa within his mind becomes absorbed in the Lord’s transcendental nature and thus becomes qualified to render personal service to the Lord in His own abode.

Synonyms
tasmāt — therefore; asat — material; abhidhyānam — processes of elevation which absorb one’s attention; yathā — just as; svapna — in a dream; manaḥ-ratham — mental concoction; hitvā — giving up; mayi — in Me; samādhatsva — completely absorb; manaḥ — the mind; mat-bhāva — by consciousness of Me; bhāvitam — purified.
Translation
Therefore, one should reject all material processes of elevation, which are like the mental creations of a dream, and should completely absorb one’s mind in Me. By constantly thinking of Me, one becomes purified.
Purport
The word bhāvitam means “caused to be.” As explained in Bhagavad-gītā, material existence is an unstable platform subject to the constant disturbances of creation and annihilation. One who absorbs his consciousness in Kṛṣṇa, however, attains to Kṛṣṇa’s nature and is therefore described as mad-bhāva-bhāvitam, or one situated in real existence because of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord here concludes His analysis of different processes of human perfection.

Translation
Being conscious of the eternal self, one should give up association with women and those intimately associated with women. Sitting fearlessly in a solitary place, one should concentrate the mind on Me with great attention.
Purport
One who has intimate contact with women and becomes attached to them will gradually lose his determination to go back home, back to Godhead. Association with lusty men gives exactly the same result. Therefore, one is advised to be fearless and to sit down in a solitary place, or a place where there are no lusty men and women committing spiritual suicide. Without fear of failure or of unhappiness in life, one should remain with sincere devotees of the Lord. Atandrita means that one should not compromise this principle but should be rigid and cautious. All this is possible only for one who is ātmavān, or fixed in practical understanding of the eternal soul.

Translation
Of all kinds of suffering and bondage arising from various attachments, none is greater than the suffering and bondage arising from attachment to women and intimate contact with those attached to women.
Purport
One should make a great endeavor to give up intimate contact with women and those fond of women. A learned gentleman will automatically be on guard if placed in intimate contact with lusty women. In the company of lusty men, however, the same man may engage in all kinds of social dealings and thus be contaminated by their polluted mentality. Association with lusty men is often more dangerous than association with women and should be avoided by all means. There are innumerable verses in the Bhāgavatam describing the intoxication of material lust. Suffice it to say that a lusty man becomes exactly like a dancing dog and, by the influence of Cupid, loses all gravity, intelligence and direction in life. The Lord warns here that one who surrenders to the illusory form of a woman suffers unbearably in this life and the next.

Translation
Śrī Uddhava said: My dear lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa, by what process should one who desires liberation meditate upon You, of what specific nature should his meditation be, and upon which form should he meditate? Kindly explain to me this topic of meditation.
Purport
It has already been elaborately explained by the Supreme Lord that without loving devotional service rendered to Him in the association of devotees, no other process of self-realization will work. Therefore it may be asked why Uddhava is again referring to the system of meditation, dhyāna. The ācāryas explain that one cannot fully appreciate the beauty and perfection of bhakti-yoga unless one sees its superiority to all other processes. Through comparative analysis, the devotees become fully ecstatic in their appreciation of bhakti-yoga. It should also be understood that although Uddhava asks about those who aspire for liberation, he is not actually a mumukṣu, or salvationist; rather, he is asking questions for the benefit of those who are not on the platform of love of Godhead. Uddhava wants to hear this knowledge for his personal appreciation and so that those who pursue salvation, or liberation, can be protected and redirected to the path of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

Translation
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Sitting on a level seat that is not too high or too low, keeping the body straight and erect yet comfortable, placing the two hands on one’s lap and focusing the eyes on the tip of one’s nose, one should purify the pathways of breathing by practicing the mechanical exercises of pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka, and then one should reverse the procedure (recaka, kumbhaka, pūraka). Having fully controlled the senses, one may thus practice prāṇāyāma step by step.
Purport
According to this procedure, the hands are to be placed palms upward, one on top of the other. Thus, one may practice prāṇāyāma through mechanical breath control in order to achieve steadiness of the mind. As stated in the yoga-śāstra, antar-lakṣyo bahir-dṛṣṭiḥ sthira-cittaḥ susaṅgataḥ: “The eyes, which generally see externally, must be turned inward, and thus the mind is steadied and fully controlled.”

hṛdy avicchinam oṁkāraṁ
ghaṇṭā-nādaṁ bisorṇa-vat
prāṇenodīrya tatrātha
punaḥ saṁveśayet svaram
Synonyms
hṛdi — in the heart; avicchinnam — uninterrupted, continuous; oṁkāram — the sacred vibration om; ghaṇṭā — like a bell; nādam — sound; bisa-ūrṇa-vat — like the fiber running up the lotus stalk; prāṇena — by the wind of prāṇa; udīrya — pushing upward; tatra — therein (at a distance of twelve thumb-breadths); atha — thus; punaḥ — again; saṁveśayet — one should join together; svaram — the fifteen vibrations produced with anusvāra..
Translation
Beginning from the mūlādhāra-cakra, one should move the life air continuously upward like the fibers in the lotus stalk until one reaches the heart, where the sacred syllable om is situated like the sound of a bell. One should thus continue raising the sacred syllable upward the distance of twelve aṅgulas, and there the oṁkāra should be joined together with the fifteen vibrations produced with anusvāra.
Purport
It appears that the yoga system is somewhat technical and difficult to perform. Anusvāra refers to a nasal vibration pronounced after the fifteen Sanskrit vowels. The complete explanation of this process is extremely complicated and obviously unsuitable for this age. From this description we can appreciate the sophisticated achievements of those who in former ages practiced mystic meditation. Despite such appreciation, however, we should stick firmly to the simple, foolproof method of meditation prescribed for the present age, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

Translation
Being fixed in the oṁkāra, one should carefully practice the prāṇāyāma system ten times at each sunrise, noon and sunset. Thus, after one month one will have conquered the life air.

Translation
Keeping the eyes half closed and fixed on the tip of one’s nose, being enlivened and alert, one should meditate on the lotus flower situated within the heart. This lotus has eight petals and is situated on an erect lotus stalk. One should meditate on the sun, moon and fire, placing them one after the other within the whorl of that lotus flower. Placing My transcendental form within the fire, one should meditate upon it as the auspicious goal of all meditation. That form is perfectly proportioned, gentle and cheerful. It possesses four beautiful long arms, a charming, beautiful neck, a handsome forehead, a pure smile and glowing, shark-shaped earrings suspended from two identical ears. That spiritual form is the color of a dark rain cloud and is garbed in golden-yellowish silk. The chest of that form is the abode of Śrīvatsa and the goddess of fortune, and that form is also decorated with a conchshell, disc, club, lotus flower and garland of forest flowers. The two brilliant lotus feet are decorated with ankle bells and bracelets, and that form exhibits the Kaustubha gem along with an effulgent crown. The upper hips are beautified by a golden belt, and the arms are decorated with valuable bracelets. All of the limbs of that beautiful form capture the heart, and the face is beautified by merciful glancing. Pulling the senses back from the sense objects, one should be grave and self-controlled and should use the intelligence to strongly fix the mind upon all of the limbs of My transcendental body. Thus one should meditate upon that most delicate transcendental form of Mine.

Lord Kṛṣṇa here answers Uddhava’s question concerning the correct procedure, nature and object of meditation for those desiring liberation.

tat sarva-vyāpakaṁ cittam
ākṛṣyaikatra dhārayet

Synonyms
tat — therefore; sarva — in all the parts of the body; vyāpakam — spread; cittam — consciousness; ākṛṣya — pulling back; ekatra — in one place; dhārayet — one should concentrate; na — not; anyāni — other limbs of the body; cintayet — one should meditate on; bhūyaḥ — again; su-smitam — wonderfully smiling or laughing; bhāvayet — one should concentrate on; mukham — the face.

तत्र लब्धपदं चित्तमाकृष्य व्योम्नि धारयेत् ।

tatra labdha-padaṁ cittam
ākṛṣya vyomni dhārayet
tac ca tyaktvā mad-āroho
na kiñcid api cintayet
Synonyms
tatra — in such meditation on the Lord’s face; labdha-padam — being established; cittam — consciousness; ākṛṣya — withdrawing; vyomni — in the sky; dhārayet — one should meditate; tat — such meditation in the sky as the cause of material manifestation; ca — also; tyaktvā — giving up; mat — to Me; ārohaḥ — having ascended; na — not; kiñcit — anything; api — at all; cintayet — one should think of.
Translation
Being established in meditation on the Lord’s face, one should then withdraw the consciousness and fix it in the sky. Then giving up such meditation, one should become established in Me and give up the process of meditation altogether.
Purport
As one becomes established in pure consciousness, the duality of “I am meditating and this is the object of my meditation” vanishes, and one comes to the stage of spontaneous relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Every living entity is originally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when that forgotten eternal relationship is revived one experiences remembrance of the Absolute Truth. In that stage, described here as mad-ārohaḥ, one no longer sees oneself as a meditator nor the Lord as a mere object of meditation, but rather one enters the spiritual sky for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge in direct loving relationship with the Lord.
Uddhava originally inquired about the procedure of meditation for those desiring liberation. The word labdha-padam indicates that when one fixes the mind upon the Lord’s face, one achieves full liberation. In the postliberation phase one then proceeds to render service to the original Personality of Godhead. By giving up the concept of being a meditator, one casts off the last small remnant of illusory energy and sees the Lord as He actually is.

एवं समाहितमतिर्मामेवात्मानमात्मनि ।

evaṁ samāhita-matir
mām evātmānam ātmani
vicaṣṭe mayi sarvātman
jyotir jyotiṣi saṁyutam
Synonyms
evam — thus; samāhita — completely fixed; matiḥ — consciousness; mām — Me; eva — indeed; ātmānam — the individual soul; ātmani — within the individual soul; vicaṣṭe — sees; mayi — in Me; sarva-ātman — in the Supreme Personality of Godhead; jyotiḥ — the sun rays; jyotiṣi — within the sun; saṁyutam — united.
Translation
One who has completely fixed his mind on Me should see Me within his own soul and should see the individual soul within Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, he sees the individual souls united with the Supreme Soul, just as one sees the sun’s rays completely united with the sun.
Purport
In the spiritual world everything is naturally effulgent because that is the nature of spirit. Thus when one sees the individual soul as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the experience can be compared to seeing the sun’s rays emanating from the sun. The Supreme Lord is within the living entity, and simultaneously the living entity is within the Lord. But in both cases the Supreme Lord, and not the living entity, is the maintainer and controller. How happy everyone could be by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and finding the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, within everything and everything within Kṛṣṇa. Liberated life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so pleasurable that the greatest misfortune is to be without such consciousness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is kindly explaining in many different ways the supremacy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and fortunate persons will understand the sincere message of the Lord.

ध्यानेनेत्थं सुतीव्रेण युञ्जतो योगिनो मन: ।

dhyānenetthaṁ su-tīvreṇa
yuñjato yogino manaḥ
saṁyāsyaty āśu nirvāṇaṁ
dravya jñāna-kriyā-bhramaḥ
Synonyms
dhyānena — by meditation; ittham — as thus mentioned; su-tīvreṇa — extremely concentrated; yuñjataḥ — of one practicing; yoginaḥ — of the yogī; manaḥ — the mind; saṁyāsyati — will go together; āśu — quickly; nirvāṇam — to extinction; dravya-jñāna-kriyā — based on perception of material objects, knowledge and activities; bhramaḥ — the illusory identification.
Translation
When the yogī thus controls his mind by intensely concentrated meditation, his illusory identification with material objects, knowledge and activities is very quickly extinguished.
Purport
Because of false material identification, we accept our own body and mind, the bodies and minds of others, and supernatural material control to be ultimate realities. Supernatural control refers to the bodies and minds of the demigods, who ultimately are humble servitors of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the mighty sun, which displays immense potencies, obediently treads its universal path by the order of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
It is clearly seen in this chapter that haṭha-yoga, karma-yoga, rāja-yoga, etc., are part and parcel of bhakti-yoga and do not actually exist separately. The goal of life is Lord Kṛṣṇa, and one must eventually come to the stage of pure devotion if one desires to perfect one’s meditation or yoga practice. In the mature stage of devotion, as described in this chapter, one becomes free from the artificial duality of meditator and object of meditation, and one spontaneously engages in hearing about and glorifying the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such activities of bhakti-yoga are natural because they spring from spontaneous love. When one revives one’s original nature as the loving servitor of Lord Kṛṣṇa, other yoga processes cease to be interesting. Uddhava was a pure devotee even before the Lord began His instruction; therefore it was not expected that Uddhava would give up the supreme platform of being a personal associate of the Lord to take up the mechanical exercises of the yoga system. Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is so elevated that even in the beginning stages of practice one is considered liberated, because all of one’s activities are executed under proper guidance for the pleasure of the Lord. In the haṭha-yoga system one is concerned with bodily control, and in jñāna-yoga one is concerned with speculative knowledge. In both systems one endeavors selfishly, desiring to become a great yogī or a philosopher. Such egoistic activity is described in this verse as kriyā. One must give up the illusory designations of dravya, jñāna and kriyā and come to the prideless stage of loving service to the Lord.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “Lord Kṛṣṇa Explains the Yoga System to Śrī Uddhava.”
