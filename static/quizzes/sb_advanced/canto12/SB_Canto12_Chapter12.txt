CHAPTER TWELVE

The Topics of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Summarized
In this chapter, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī summarizes the subjects discussed in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.
The Supreme Lord, Śrī Hari, personally removes all the distress of a person who hears about His glories. Whatever words glorify the innumerable transcendental qualities of the Personality of Godhead are truthful, auspicious and conducive to piety, whereas all other words are impure. Discussions of topics concerning the Supreme Lord bestow ecstasy, which remains constantly new, but persons who are like crows become absorbed in unessential topics, those unrelated to the Personality of Godhead.
By chanting and hearing the countless names of Lord Śrī Hari, which describe His glorious qualities, all human beings can be relieved of their sins. Neither knowledge devoid of devotion for Lord Viṣṇu nor fruitive work not offered to Him have any real beauty. By constant remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa, on the other hand, all one’s inauspicious desires are destroyed, one’s mind is purified, and one attains devotion for Lord Śrī Hari along with knowledge filled with realization and detachment.
Sūta Gosvāmī then states that previously, in the assembly of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, he heard from the mouth of Śrī Śukadeva the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which annihilate all sinful reactions, and that now he has related these glories to the sages at Naimiṣāraṇya. By hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the spirit soul is purified and obtains salvation from all sins and all kinds of fear. Through the study of this scripture, one achieves the same result as that achieved by one who studies all the Vedas, and one also achieves the fulfillment of all desires. By studying with a controlled mind this essential compilation of all the Purāṇas, one will reach the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead. Every verse of this scripture, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, contains the narrations of Lord Śrī Hari, who has innumerable personal forms.
Finally, Śrī Sūta offers obeisances to the unborn and unlimited Supreme Soul, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as well as to Śrī Śukadeva, the son of Vyāsa, who is capable of destroying the sins of all living beings.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that it would be difficult to give a complete list of the numerous accounts and topics contained in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Therefore it is understood that Sūta Gosvāmī is merely summarizing the topics. We should not consider the topics he fails to mention here less important or superfluous, since every letter and word of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is absolute, Kṛṣṇa conscious sound vibration.

Purport
One may not be satisfied by the example of the sun removing the darkness, since sometimes the darkness in a cave is not removed by the sun. Therefore the example is given of a strong wind that drives away a cover of clouds. It is thus emphatically stated here that the Supreme Lord will remove from the heart of His devotee the darkness of material illusion.

Purport
Sooner or later, all material literature and discussion must fail the test of time. On the other hand, the transcendental descriptions of the Supreme Lord can free us from the bondage of illusion and restore us to our eternal status as loving servants of the Lord. Although men who are like animals may criticize the glorification of the Absolute Truth, those who are civilized should go on vigorously propagating the transcendental glories of the Lord.

Knowledge of self-realization, even though free from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the Infallible [God]. What, then, is the use of even the most properly performed fruitive activities, which are naturally painful from the very beginning and transient by nature, if they are not utilized for the devotional service of the Lord?
Purport
This and the previous two verses are found in a slightly different form in the First Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.5.10-12). The translations are based on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s.

Translation
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, the son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. It is he who defeats all inauspicious things within this universe. Although in the beginning he was absorbed in the happiness of Brahman realization and was living in a secluded place, giving up all other types of consciousness, he became attracted by the pleasing, most melodious pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He therefore mercifully spoke this supreme Purāṇa, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is the bright light of the Absolute Truth and which describes the activities of the Lord.
Purport
Without offering respectful obeisances to Śukadeva Gosvāmī and other great ācāryas in his line, one cannot possibly gain the privilege of entering into the deep transcendental meaning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Twelfth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Topics of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Summarized.”
