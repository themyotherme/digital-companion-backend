CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE

Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna Retrieve a Brāhmaṇa’s Sons
This chapter describes how Bhṛgu Muni proved the supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, and how Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna recovered the dead sons of an aggrieved brāhmaṇa in Dvārakā.
Once, long ago, on the shore of the river Sarasvatī, a discussion arose among a group of sages as to which of the three chief lords — Brahmā, Viṣṇu or Śiva — is the greatest. They deputed Bhṛgu Muni to investigate the matter.
Bhṛgu decided to test the lords’ tolerance, for that quality is a sure sign of greatness. First he entered the court of Lord Brahmā, his father, without offering him any respect. This enraged Brahmā, who suppressed his anger because Bhṛgu was his son. Next Bhṛgu went to Lord Śiva, his older brother, who rose from his seat to embrace him. But Bhṛgu rejected the embrace, calling Śiva a deviant heretic. Just as Śiva was about to kill Bhṛgu with his trident, Goddess Pārvatī interceded and pacified her husband. Next Bhṛgu went to Vaikuṇṭha to test Lord Nārāyaṇa. Going up to the Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of the goddess of fortune, Bhṛgu kicked His chest. But instead of becoming angry, both the Lord and His consort stood up and offered Bhṛgu respects. “Welcome,” said the Lord. “Please sit down and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival.” When Bhṛgu went back to the assembly of sages and told them all that had happened, they concluded that Lord Viṣṇu is certainly supreme.
Once in Dvārakā a brāhmaṇa’s wife gave birth to a son who immediately died. The brāhmaṇa took his dead son to the court of King Ugrasena and berated the King: “This duplicitous, greedy enemy of brāhmaṇas has caused my son’s death by failing to execute his duties properly!” The same misfortune continued to befall the brāhmaṇa, and each time he would bring his dead infant’s body to the royal court and berate the King. When the ninth son died at birth, Arjuna happened to hear the brāhmaṇa’s complaint, and he said, “My lord, I will protect your progeny. And if I fail, I will enter fire to atone for my sin.”
Some time later, the brāhmaṇa’s wife was about to give birth for the tenth time. When Arjuna learned of this, he went to the maternity house and enveloped it with a protective cage of arrows. Arjuna’s efforts were to no avail, however, for as soon as the child was born and began to cry, it disappeared into the sky. As the brāhmaṇa profusely derided Arjuna, the warrior set off for the abode of Yamarāja, the king of death. But Arjuna did not find the brāhmaṇa’s son there, and even after searching throughout the fourteen worlds he could find no trace of the infant.
Having failed to protect the brāhmaṇa’s son, Arjuna was now intent on committing suicide by entering the sacred fire. But just as he was about to do so, Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped him and said, “I will show you the brāhmaṇa’s sons, so please don’t despise yourself like this.” Lord Kṛṣṇa then took Arjuna onto His transcendental chariot, and the two of them crossed over the seven universal islands with their seven oceans, passed over the Lokāloka mountain range and entered the region of dense darkness. Since the horses could not find their way, Kṛṣṇa sent His blazing Sudarśana disc ahead to pierce the gloom. Gradually they came to the water of the Causal Ocean, within which they found the city of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. There they saw the thousand-hooded serpent Ananta and upon Him lay Mahā-Viṣṇu. The great Lord greeted Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, saying “I brought the brāhmaṇa’s sons here simply because I wanted to see the two of you. Please continue to benefit the people in general by exemplifying religious behavior in your forms of Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi.”
Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna then took the brāhmaṇa’s sons, went back to Dvārakā and returned the infants to their father. Having directly experienced the greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna was amazed. He concluded that only by the Lord’s mercy can a living being exhibit any power or opulence.

śrī-śukaḥ uvāca — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; sarasvatyāḥ — of the river Sarasvatī; taṭe — on the bank; rājan — O King (Parīkṣit); ṛṣayaḥ — sages; satram — a Vedic sacrifice; āsata — were performing; vitarkaḥ — a disagreement; samabhūt — arose; teṣām — among them; triṣu — among the three; adhīśeṣu — chief lords; kaḥ — who; mahān — the greatest.
Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Once, O King, as a group of sages were performing a Vedic sacrifice on the banks of the Sarasvatī River, a controversy arose among them as to which of the three chief deities is supreme.
Purport
The three chief deities mentioned here are Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva.

तस्य जिज्ञासया ते वै भृगुं ब्रह्मसुतं नृप ।
तज्ज्ञप्‍त्‍यै प्रेषयामासु: सोऽभ्यगाद् ब्रह्मण: सभाम् ॥ २ ॥
tasya jijñāsayā te vai
bhṛguṁ brahma-sutaṁ nṛpa

Translation
Eager to resolve this question, O King, the sages sent Lord Brahmā’s son Bhṛgu to find the answer. First he went to his father’s court.
Purport
As Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: “The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhṛgu to test which one of the predominating deities possessed the quality of goodness in full.” One who is in the mode of goodness possesses such qualities as tolerance and equanimity, whereas those conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance are prone to easily lose their temper.

न तस्मै प्रह्वणं स्तोत्रं चक्रे सत्त्वपरीक्षया ।

na tasmai prahvaṇaṁ stotraṁ
cakre sattva-parīkṣayā
tasmai cukrodha bhagavān
prajvalan svena tejasā
Synonyms
na — not; tasmai — to him (Brahmā); prahvaṇam — bowing down; stotram — recitation of prayers; cakre — made; sattva — his situation in the mode of goodness; parīkṣayā — with the aim of testing; tasmai — at him; cukrodha — became angry; bhagavān — the lord; prajvalan — becoming inflamed; svena — with his own; tejasā — passion.
Translation
To test how well Lord Brahmā was situated in the mode of goodness, Bhṛgu failed to bow down to him or glorify him with prayers. The lord became angry at him, inflamed into fury by his own passion.

स आत्मन्युत्थितं मन्युमात्मजायात्मना प्रभु: ।
अशीशमद् यथा वह्निं स्वयोन्या वारिणात्मभू: ॥ ४ ॥
sa ātmany utthitam manyum
ātmajāyātmanā prabhuḥ
aśīśamad yathā vahniṁ
sva-yonyā vāriṇātma-bhūḥ
Synonyms
saḥ — he; ātmani — within himself; utthitam — risen; manyum — anger; ātma-jāya — toward his son; ātmanā — by his own intelligence; prabhuḥ — the lord; aśīśamat — subdued; yathā — just as; vahnim — fire; sva — itself; yonyā — whose origin; vāriṇā — by water; ātma-bhūḥ — self-born Brahmā.
Translation
Though anger toward his son was now rising within his heart, Lord Brahmā was able to subdue it by applying his intelligence, in the same way that fire is extinguished by its own product, water.
Purport
Lord Brahmā is sometimes affected by his contact with the mode of passion. But because he is ādi-kavi, the firstborn and foremost learned scholar in the universe, when anger begins to disturb his mind he can control it by means of discriminating self-examination. In this instance he reminded himself that Bhṛgu was his son. Thus in this verse Śukadeva Gosvāmī draws the analogy that Brahmā’s own expansion (his son) served to put out his anger just as water, which originally evolved from elemental fire in the primeval creation, puts out a fire.

Translation
Bhṛgu then went to Mount Kailāsa. There Lord Śiva stood up and happily came forward to embrace his brother.
Purport
In the Vedic civilization it is considered very important to properly greet one’s family members, especially when one has not seen them for a long time. A worthy son should show respect to his father, a younger brother should honor his older brother, and the older brother should show affection to his younger brother in turn.

Synonyms
na aicchat — he did not desire this (embrace); tvam — you; asi — are; utpatha-gaḥ — a transgressor of the path (of religion); iti — so saying; devaḥ — the lord (Śiva); cukopa ha — became angry; śūlam — his trident; udyamya — raising; tam — him (Bhṛgu); hantum — to kill; ārebhe — was about; tigma — fierce; locanaḥ — whose eyes; patitvā — falling; pādayoḥ — at (Lord Śiva’s) feet; devī — Goddess Devī; sāntvayām āsa — pacified; tam — him; girā — with words; atha u — then; jagāma — (Bhṛgu) went; vaikuṇṭham — to the spiritual planet of Vaikuṇṭha; yatra — where; devaḥ janārdanaḥ — Lord Janārdana (Viṣṇu).
Translation
But Bhṛgu refused his embrace, telling him, “You are a deviant heretic.” At this Lord Śiva became angry, and his eyes burned ferociously. He raised his trident and was about to kill Bhṛgu when Goddess Devī fell at his feet and spoke some words to pacify him. Bhṛgu then left that place and went to Vaikuṇṭha, where Lord Janārdana resides.
Purport
In Kṛṣṇa, Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “It is said that an offense can be committed either with the body, with the mind or by speech. Bhṛgu Muni’s first offense, committed toward Lord Brahmā, was an offense with the mind. His second offense, committed toward Lord Śiva by insulting him, criticizing him for unclean habits, was an offense by speech. Because the quality of ignorance is prominent in Lord Śiva, when he heard Bhṛgu’s insult his eyes immediately became red with anger. With uncontrollable rage, he took up his trident and prepared to kill Bhṛgu Muni. At that time Lord Śiva’s wife, Pārvatī, was present. Her personality, like Lord Siva’s, is a mixture of the three qualities, and therefore she is called Triguṇa-mayī. In this case, she saved the situation by evoking Lord Śiva’s quality of goodness.”
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī remarks that the Vaikuṇṭha planet referred to here is Śvetadvīpa.

Translation
There he went up to the Supreme Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of His consort, Śrī, and kicked Him on the chest. The Lord then rose, along with Goddess Lakṣmī, as a sign of respect. Coming down from His bedstead, that supreme goal of all pure devotees bowed His head to the floor before the sage and told him, ‘Welcome, brāhmaṇa. Please sit in this chair and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival.’
Purport
According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, at the time of this pastime Bhṛgu Muni had not yet become a pure Vaiṣṇava; otherwise he would not have acted so rashly toward the Supreme Lord. Not only was Lord Viṣṇu taking rest, but He was lying with His head in His wife’s lap. For Bhṛgu to strike Him in this position — and not with his hand but with his foot — was worse than any other offense Bhṛgu could have imagined.
Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “Of course, Lord Viṣṇu is all-merciful. He did not become angry at the activities of Bhṛgu Muni, for Bhṛgu Muni was a great brāhmaṇa. A brāhmaṇa is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viṣṇu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, has not been very favorably disposed toward the brāhmaṇas, and therefore because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the brāhmaṇas are generally very poor.”

Translation
“Please purify Me, My realm and the realms of the universal rulers devoted to Me by giving us the water that has washed your feet. This holy water is indeed what makes all places of pilgrimage sacred. Today, my lord, I have become the exclusive shelter of the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī; she will consent to reside on My chest because your foot has rid it of sins.”
Purport
Continuing his comments, Śrīla Prabhupāda says: “The so-called brāhmaṇas of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud that a great brāhmaṇa like Bhṛgu Muni could touch the chest of Lord Viṣṇu with his foot. But in fact, when Bhṛgu Muni kicked the chest of Lord Viṣṇu it was the greatest offense, although Lord Viṣṇu, being greatly magnanimous, did not take it very seriously.”
Some editions of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam contain the following verse between texts 11 and 12, and Śrīla Prabhupāda also includes it in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his summary study of the Tenth Canto:
atīva-komalau tāta
caraṇau te mahā-mune
ity uktvā vipra-caraṇau
mardayan svena pāṇinā
“[The Lord said to the brāhmaṇa Bhṛgu:] ‘My dear sir, O great sage, your feet are indeed very tender.’ Saying this, Lord Viṣṇu began massaging the brāhmaṇa’s feet with His own hands.”

Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Bhṛgu felt satisfied and delighted to hear the solemn words spoken by Lord Vaikuṇṭha. Overwhelmed with devotional ecstasy, he remained silent, his eyes brimming with tears.
Purport
Bhṛgu could not offer the Lord any words of praise because his throat was choking with tears of ecstasy. In the opinion of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the sage should not be condemned for his offensive behavior, since his role in this transcendental pastime was arranged by the Personality of Godhead.

Translation
Amazed upon hearing Bhṛgu’s account, the sages were freed from all doubts and became convinced that Viṣṇu is the greatest Lord. From Him come peace; fearlessness; the essential principles of religion; detachment with knowledge; the eightfold powers of mystic yoga; and His glorification, which cleanses the mind of all impurities. He is known as the supreme destination for those who are peaceful and equipoised — the selfless, wise saints who have given up all violence. His most dear form is that of pure goodness, and the brāhmaṇas are His worshipable deities. Persons of keen intellect who have attained spiritual peace worship Him without selfish motives.
Purport
By becoming devoted to the Personality of Godhead, one easily attains divine knowledge and detachment from sense gratification, without separate endeavor. As described in the Eleventh Canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (11.2.42):
bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir
anyatra caiṣa trika eka-kālaḥ
prapadyamānasya yathāśnataḥ syus
tuṣṭiḥ puṣṭiḥ kṣud-apāyo ’nu-ghāsam
“Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things — these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.” Similarly, in the First Canto (1.2.7), Śrīla Suta Gosvāmī states:
vāsudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam
“By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.”
Lord Śrī Kapila, in His instructions to His mother, Devahūti, proposes that the eightfold powers of yoga are also coincidental fruits of devotional service:
atho vibhūtiṁ mama māyāvinas tām
aiśvaryam aṣṭāṅgam anupravṛttam
śrīyaṁ bhāgavatīṁ vāspṛhayanti bhadrāṁ
parasya me te ’śnuvate hi loke
“Because he is completely absorbed in thought of Me, My devotee does not desire even the highest benediction obtainable in the upper planetary systems, including Satyaloka. He does not desire the eight material perfections obtained from mystic yoga, nor does he desire to be elevated to the kingdom of God. Yet even without desiring them, My devotee enjoys, even in this life, all the offered benedictions.” (Bhāg. 3.25.37)
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that in text 16, three kinds of transcendentalists are named: the munis, the śāntas and the sādhus. These are, in order of increasing importance, persons striving for liberation, those who have attained liberation, and those who are engaged in pure devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu.
Text 18
त्रिविधाकृतयस्तस्य राक्षसा असुरा: सुरा: ।

tri-vidhākṛtayas tasya
rākṣasā asurāḥ surāḥ
guṇinyā māyayā sṛṣṭāḥ
sattvaṁ tat tīrtha-sādhanam
Synonyms
tri-vidha — of three kinds; ākṛtayaḥ — forms; tasya — of His; rākṣasāḥ — the ignorant spirits; asurāḥ — the demons; surāḥ — and the demigods; guṇinyāḥ — qualified by the material modes; māyayā — by His material energy; sṛṣṭāḥ — created; sattvam — the mode of goodness; tat — among them; tīrtha — of success in life; sādhanam — the means of attainment.
Translation
The Lord expands into three kinds of manifest beings — the Rākṣasas, the demons and the demigods — all of whom are created by the Lord’s material energy and conditioned by her modes. But among these three modes, it is the mode of goodness which is the means of attaining life’s final success.
Purport
In Kṛṣṇa Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “There are different kinds of people existing in the modes of material nature. Those who are in the mode of ignorance are called rākṣasas, those in the mode of passion are called asuras [demons], and those in the mode of goodness are called suras, or demigods. Under the direction of the Supreme Lord, these three classes of men are created by material nature, but those who are in the mode of goodness have a greater chance to be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead.”

Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: Thus did this fragrant nectar flow from the lotus mouth of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of the sage Vyāsadeva. This wonderful glorification of the Supreme Person destroys all fear of material existence. A traveler who constantly drinks this nectar through his ear-holes will forget the fatigue brought on by wandering along the paths of worldly life.
Purport
This narration by Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī is precious in two ways: For those suffering from spiritual infirmity it is an effective tonic to cure the disease of illusion. And for surrendered Vaiṣṇavas it is a delicious and invigorating beverage, fragrant with the aroma of Śrī Śuka’s realizations.

Purport
In this chapter Lord Viṣṇu has been glorified as the Supreme Godhead. Now Śukadeva Gosvāmī is going to identify Lord Kṛṣṇa with that same Personality of Godhead by describing another pastime of His, one which highlighted His unequaled, divine characteristics.

Translation
[The brāhmaṇa said:] This duplicitous, greedy enemy of brāhmaṇas, this unqualified ruler addicted to sense pleasure, has caused my son’s death by some discrepancies in the execution of his duties.
Purport
Presuming that he himself had done nothing to cause his son’s death, the brāhmaṇa thought it reasonable to blame King Ugrasena. In the Vedic social system, the monarch is considered responsible for everything occurring in his kingdom, good or bad. Even in a democracy, a manager who takes charge of some group or project should accept personal responsibility for any failure rather than, as is so common today, trying to place the blame on his subordinates or superiors.

These kṣatriyas are behaving as if they were brāhmaṇas idly engaged in fire sacrifices.

Finally, not having found the brāhmaṇa’s son anywhere, Arjuna decided to enter the sacred fire, having failed to keep his promise. But just as he was about to do so, Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped him and spoke the following words.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that Arjuna trusted Lord Śiva implicitly as his guru, and so he did not bother to search out Lord Śiva’s celestial abode.

The Lord’s chariot passed over the seven islands of the middle universe, each with its ocean and its seven principal mountains. Then it crossed the Lokāloka boundary and entered the vast region of total darkness.
Purport
In Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrīla Prabhupāda notes: “Kṛṣṇa passed over all these planets and reached the covering of the universe. This covering is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as great darkness. This material world as a whole is described as dark. In the open space there is sunlight, and therefore it is illuminated, but in the covering, because of the absence of sunlight, it is naturally dark.”

In that darkness the chariot’s horses — Śaibya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka — lost their way. Seeing them in this condition, O best of the Bhāratas, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme master of all masters of yoga, sent His Sudarśana disc before the chariot. That disc shone like thousands of suns.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following insight into this verse. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s horses had descended from Vaikuṇṭha to participate in His earthly pastimes. Since the Lord Himself was pretending to be a finite human being, His steeds now acted confused to enhance the drama of the situation for all who would one day hear this pastime.

Purport
After breaking through each of the eight concentric shells of the universe, the Sudarśana disc led Lord Kṛṣṇa’s chariot into the limitless, self-effulgent atmosphere of the spiritual sky. This journey by Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to Vaikuṇṭha is also narrated in Śrī Hari-vaṁśa, where the Lord is quoted as telling His companion:
brahma-tejo-mayaṁ divyaṁ
mahat yad dṛṣṭavān asi
ahaṁ sa bharata-śreṣṭha
mat-tejas tat sanātanam
“The divine expanse of Brahman effulgence you have seen is none other than Myself, O best of the Bhāratas. It is My own eternal effulgence.”

Translation
Arjuna then saw the omnipresent and omnipotent Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahā-Viṣṇu, sitting at ease on the serpent bed. His bluish complexion was the color of a dense rain cloud, He wore a beautiful yellow garment, His face looked charming, His broad eyes were most attractive, and He had eight long, handsome arms. His profuse locks of hair were bathed on all sides in the brilliance reflected from the clusters of precious jewels decorating His crown and earrings. He wore the Kaustubha gem, the mark of Śrīvatsa and a garland of forest flowers. Serving that topmost of all Lords were His personal attendants, headed by Sunanda and Nanda; His cakra and other weapons in their personified forms; His consort potencies Puṣṭi, Śrī, Kīrti and Ajā; and all His various mystic powers.
Purport
Śrīla Prabhupāda mentions that “the Lord has innumerable energies, and they were also standing there personified. The most important among them were as follows: Puṣṭi, the energy for nourishment; Śrī, the energy of beauty; Kīrti, the energy of reputation; and Ajā, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, and in the kings of the heavenly planets, Indra, Candra, Varuṇa and the sungod. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

Translation
Lord Kṛṣṇa offered homage to Himself in this boundless form, and Arjuna, astonished at the sight of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, bowed down as well. Then, as the two of them stood before Him with joined palms, the almighty Mahā-Viṣṇu, supreme master of all rulers of the universe, smiled and spoke to them in a voice full of solemn authority.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī makes the following observations on this verse: Just as Lord Kṛṣṇa offered obeisances to His own Deity during the worship of Govardhana Hill, so now also He paid homage to His Viṣṇu expansion for the purpose of playing out His pastimes. The Lord is ananta, possessed of countless manifestations, and this eight-armed form is among them. He is acyuta, “never falling from His position,” in the sense that He never stops engaging in His humanlike pastimes as a cowherd boy of Vṛndāvana. Thus to safeguard the special sanctity of His humanlike pastimes as Kṛṣṇa, He offered obeisances to His own plenary expansion.
Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu appeared before Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna as bhūmā, the supremely opulent one, and as parameṣṭhināṁ prabhuḥ, the Lord of multitudes of Brahmās ruling over millions of universes. With solemn authority He spoke in such a way as to bewilder Arjuna, in obedience to Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s intention. His smile hinted at His private thoughts, which Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has revealed for our benefit: “My dear Kṛṣṇa, by Your desire I will describe My superiority, even though I am Your expansion. At the same time, however, I will subtly imply in My statements the supreme position of Your beauty, character and power and the fact that You are the source from which I emanate. Just see how clever I am — that in front of Arjuna I am confidentially divulging My true identity as nondifferent from You.”

[Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu said:] I brought the brāhmaṇa’s sons here because I wanted to see the two of you, My expansions, who have descended to the earth to save the principles of religion. As soon as you finish killing the demons who burden the earth, quickly come back here to Me.
Purport
As explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the secret import of these words spoken for Arjuna’s edification is as follows: “You two, who have descended along with your kalās, your personal energies, should kindly return to Me after killing the demons who burden the earth. Please quickly send these demons here to Me for the sake of their liberation.” It is stated in Śrī Hari-vaṁśa and in the Second Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam that the path of gradual liberation passes through the intermediate station of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu’s abode, outside the eighth shell of the universe.

There they presented the brāhmaṇa with his sons, who were in the same infant bodies in which they had been lost.

Translation
Having seen the domain of Lord Viṣṇu, Arjuna was totally amazed. He concluded that whatever extraordinary power a person exhibits can only be a manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s mercy.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes Arjuna’s amazement: He thought, “Just see! Even though I am a mere mortal, by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy I have seen the Supreme Godhead, the root cause of everything.” Then, after a moment, he thought again, “But why did Lord Viṣṇu say that he took away the brāhmaṇa’s children out of a desire to see Kṛṣṇa? Why would the Supreme Personality of Godhead hanker to see His own expansion? This might be the effect of some peculiar temporary circumstance, but since He said didṛkṣuṇā instead of didṛkṣatā — where the specific suffix ṣuṇā carries the sense of a permanent characteristic, not a temporary one — it has to be concluded that He has always been wanting to see Kṛṣṇa and myself. Even granted that this is so, why couldn’t He simply see Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā? After all, Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu is the all-pervading creator of the universe, which He holds like an āmalaka fruit in His hand. Is it that He could not see Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā because Kṛṣṇa does not allow anyone to see Him without His special sanction?
“And why, also, would Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, the compassionate master of all brāhmaṇas, have repeatedly tormented an elevated brāhmaṇa, year after year? He must have acted in this unusual way only because He could not give up His extreme eagerness to see Kṛṣṇa. All right, He may have acted improperly for that reason, but why couldn’t He have sent a servant to kidnap the brāhmaṇa’s sons? Why did He Himself have to come to Dvārakā? Was stealing them out of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s capital so difficult that no one but Viṣṇu Himself could hope to accomplish it? I can understand that He intended to cause so much distress to a brāhmaṇa of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s city that Kṛṣṇa would be unable to tolerate it; then He would grant Lord Viṣṇu His audience. Lord Viṣṇu inspired the distressed brāhmaṇa to pour out his complaints to Kṛṣṇa in person. Thus it is clear that Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s status of Godhood is superior to Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu’s.”
Having thought in this way, Arjuna was totally amazed. He asked Lord Kṛṣṇa whether these were actually the facts of the matter, and the Lord replied, as related in the Hari-vaṁśa:
mad-darśanārthaṁ te bālā
hṛtās tena mahātmanā
viprārtham eṣyate kṛṣṇo
mat-samīpaṁ na cānyathā
“It was to see Me that He, the Supreme Soul, stole the children. He believed, ‘Only on a brāhmaṇa’s behalf will Kṛṣṇa come to see Me, not otherwise.’”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that Lord Kṛṣṇa further told Arjuna, “I did not go there, however, for the brāhmaṇa’s sake; I went there, My friend, just to save your life. If it had been for the brāhmaṇa’s sake that I traveled to Vaikuṇṭha, I would have done so after his first child was abducted.”
According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, although this pastime occurred before the Battle of Kurukṣetra, it is recounted here at the end of the Tenth Canto under the general heading of the supremacy of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glories.
