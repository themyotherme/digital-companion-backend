CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

The Brāhmaṇas’ Wives Blessed
This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, after inducing the cowherd boys to beg for food, showed mercy to the wives of some brāhmaṇas performing a sacrifice and made the brāhmaṇas themselves feel remorse.
When the cowherd boys became very hungry, they asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa about obtaining food, and He sent them to beg some from a group of brāhmaṇas who were performing a sacrifice nearby. But these brāhmaṇas ignored the boys, thinking Śrī Kṛṣṇa an ordinary human being. The boys returned disappointed, but the Lord sent them off again, advising them to ask the brāhmaṇas’ wives for the food. These ladies had heard of Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental qualities and were very much attached to Him. Thus as soon as they learned He was nearby, they went to Him in great haste, bringing all four varieties of food. In this way they offered themselves to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Kṛṣṇa told the women that while one can develop transcendental love for Him by seeing His Deity form in the temple, meditating upon Him and chanting His glories, one cannot achieve this result simply by being in His physical presence. He advised them that since they were housewives, their particular duty was to help their husbands perform sacrifices. He therefore instructed them to return to their homes.
When the ladies went back home, their brāhmaṇa husbands at once felt remorse, and they lamented, “For anyone inimical to Kṛṣṇa, his three births — seminal, brahminical and sacrificial — are all condemned. On the other hand, these womenfolk, who have not undergone the purificatory processes of the brahminical class or performed any austerity or pious rituals, have through devotion for Kṛṣṇa easily cut off the bondage of death.
“Since Lord Kṛṣṇa’s every desire is completely fulfilled, His begging for food was simply an act of mercy toward us brāhmaṇas. All the fruits of Vedic sacrifice — and indeed all things on earth — are His opulences, yet out of ignorance we could not appreciate this fact.”
Having spoken thus, all the brāhmaṇas offered their obeisances to Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, hoping to counteract their offense. Nonetheless, out of fear of King Kaṁsa they did not go to see the Lord in person.

Translation
The cowherd boys said: O Rāma, Rāma, mighty-armed one! O Kṛṣṇa, chastiser of the wicked! We are being harassed by hunger, and You should do something about it.
Purport
The cowherd boys jokingly implied that since Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the subduer of all bad things, the Lord should subdue their hunger by arranging for them to eat. In this statement by the cowherd boys, we observe the intimate loving friendship they enjoyed with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa encouraged His boyfriends to request charity without being embarrassed. In case the boys felt they had no right to personally approach such respectable brāhmaṇas, the Lord told them to mention the names of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa, the holy names of God.

he bhūmi-devāḥ śṛṇuta

Synonyms
he bhūmi-devāḥ — O earthly gods; śṛṇuta — please hear us; kṛṣṇasya ādeśa — of the order of Kṛṣṇa; kāriṇaḥ — the executors; prāptān — arrived; jānīta — please recognize; bhadram — all good; vaḥ — unto you; gopān — cowherd boys; naḥ — us; rāma-coditān — sent by Lord Rāma.
Translation
[The cowherd boys said:] O earthly gods, please hear us. We cowherd boys are executing the orders of Kṛṣṇa, and we have been sent here by Balarāma. We wish all good for you. Please acknowledge our arrival.
Purport
The term bhūmi-devāḥ, “gods on earth,” refers here to the brāhmaṇas, who are supposed to closely represent the will of the Supreme Lord. The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding that human beings on the earth are gods. Rather, it is a science that traces the descent of authority from the Absolute Truth Himself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The authority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of His creation, and on the earth the Lord’s will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called brāhmaṇas.
This account will illustrate that the ritualistic brāhmaṇas approached by the cowherd boys were not at all properly enlightened and thus could not appreciate the position of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma or that of Their intimate associates. In fact, this pastime exposes the pretentious position of so-called brāhmaṇas who are not faithful devotees of the Supreme Lord.

गाश्चारयन्तावविदूर ओदनं

gāś cārayantāv avidūra odanaṁ

Synonyms
gāḥ — Their cows; cārayantau — grazing; avidūre — not far away; odanam — food; rāma-acyutau — Lord Rāma and Lord Acyuta; vaḥ — from you; laṣataḥ — are desiring; bubhukṣitau — being hungry; tayoḥ — for Them; dvijāḥ — O brāhmaṇas; odanam — food; arthinoḥ — begging; yadi — if; śraddhā — any faith; ca — and; vaḥ — on your part; yacchata — please give; dharma-vit-tamāḥ — O best knowers of the principles of religion.
Translation
Lord Rāma and Lord Acyuta are tending Their cows not far from here. They are hungry and want you to give Them some of your food. Therefore, O brāhmaṇas, O best of the knowers of religion, if you have faith please give some food to Them.
Purport
The cowherd boys doubted the generosity of the brāhmaṇas, and thus they used the word bubhukṣitau, meaning that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were hungry. The boys expected the brāhmaṇas to know the Vedic injunction annasya kṣuditaṁ pātram: “Anyone who is hungry is a fit candidate for receiving food in charity.” But if the brāhmaṇas would not recognize the authority of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, their title dvija would be taken to mean merely “born from two parents” (dvi — from two, ja — born) rather than “twice-born.” When the brāhmaṇas did not respond to the cowherd boys’ initial request, the boys addressed the brāhmaṇas, with a slight trace of sarcasm, as dharma-vit-tamāḥ, “O best of the knowers of religion.”

दीक्षाया: पशुसंस्थाया: सौत्रामण्याश्च सत्तमा: ।
अन्यत्र दीक्षितस्यापि नान्नमश्नन् हि दुष्यति ॥ ८ ॥
dīkṣāyāḥ paśu-saṁsthāyāḥ
sautrāmaṇyāś ca sattamāḥ
anyatra dīkṣitasyāpi
nānnam aśnan hi duṣyati
Synonyms
dīkṣāyāḥ — beginning with the initiation for a sacrifice; paśu-saṁsthāyāḥ — until sacrificing the animal; sautrāmaṇyāḥ — outside of the sacrifice known as Sautrāmaṇi; ca — and; sat-tamāḥ — O purest ones; anyatra — elsewhere; dīkṣitasya — of one who has been initiated for the sacrifice; api — even; na — not; annam — food; aśnan — eating; hi — indeed; duṣyati — creates offense.
Translation
Except during the interval between the initiation of the performer of a sacrifice and the actual sacrifice of the animal, O most pure brāhmaṇas, it is not contaminating for even the initiated to partake of food, at least in sacrifices other than the Sautrāmaṇi.
Purport
The cowherd boys anticipated the possible objection from the brāhmaṇas that they couldn’t give the boys any food because they themselves had not yet eaten, and that a priest initiated to perform a sacrifice should not eat. Therefore the boys humbly informed the brāhmaṇas about various technicalities of ritualistic sacrifice. The cowherd boys were not unaware of the formalities of Vedic culture, but their real intention was simply to render loving service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

इति ते भगवद्याच्ञां श‍ृण्वन्तोऽपि न शुश्रुवु: ।

Translation
The brāhmaṇas heard this supplication from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet they refused to pay heed. Indeed, they were full of petty desires and entangled in elaborate rituals. Though presuming themselves advanced in Vedic learning, they were actually inexperienced fools.
Purport
These childish brāhmaṇas were full of petty desires, such as the desire to attain to material heaven, and therefore they could not recognize the golden transcendental opportunity offered them by the arrival of Kṛṣṇa’s personal boyfriends. Presently, throughout the world, people are madly pursuing material advancement and thus cannot hear the message of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa that is being broadcast through the missionary activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Times have hardly changed, and proud, materialistic priests are still prevalent on the earth.

Synonyms
deśaḥ — the place; kālaḥ — time; pṛthak dravyam — particular items of paraphernalia; mantra — Vedic hymns; tantra — prescribed rituals; ṛtvijaḥ — priests; agnayaḥ — sacrificial fires; devatāḥ — the presiding demigods; yajamānaḥ — the performer of the sacrifice; ca — and; kratuḥ — the offering; dharmaḥ — the invisible power of fruitive results; ca — and; yat — whom; mayaḥ — constituting; tam — Him; brahma paramam — the Supreme Absolute Truth; sākṣāt — directly manifest; bhagavantam — the Personality of Godhead; adhokṣajam — who is transcendental to material senses; manuṣya-dṛṣṭyā — seeing Him as an ordinary man; duṣprajñāḥ — perverted in their intelligence; martya-ātmānaḥ — falsely identifying themselves with the material body; na menire — they did not properly honor.
Translation
Although the ingredients of sacrificial performance — the place, time, particular paraphernalia, mantras, rituals, priests, fires, demigods, performer, offering and the as yet unseen beneficial results — are all simply aspects of His opulences, the brāhmaṇas saw Lord Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary human because of their perverted intelligence. They failed to recognize that He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the directly manifest Personality of Godhead, whom the material senses cannot ordinarily perceive. Thus bewildered by their false identification with the mortal body, they did not show Him proper respect.
Purport
The ritualistic brāhmaṇas could not understand why the sacrificial food should be offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa, whom they considered an ordinary human being. Just as a person with rose-colored glasses sees the entire world as rose-colored, a conditioned soul with mundane vision sees even God Himself as mundane and thus loses the opportunity to go back home, back to Godhead.

Translation
When the brāhmaṇas failed to reply even with a simple yes or no, O chastiser of the enemy [Parīkṣit], the cowherd boys returned disappointed to Kṛṣṇa and Rāma and reported this to Them.

Purport
By laughing, Lord Kṛṣṇa indicated to the cowherd boys that they need not be angry at the ritualistic brāhmaṇas but should understand that one who begs will often be refused.

[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:] Tell the wives of the brāhmaṇas that I have come here with Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. They will certainly give you all the food you want, for they are most affectionate toward Me and, indeed, with their intelligence reside in Me alone.
Purport
While physically the wives of the brāhmaṇas remained at home, within their minds they resided in the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa because of intense affection for Him. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that the reason Lord Kṛṣṇa did not have the cowherd boys tell the brāhmaṇas’ wives He was hungry is that He knew this would severely distress these devoted ladies. Simply out of affection for Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, the wives would be happy to give all the food requested of them. They would not heed their husbands’ prohibitions, since they resided within the Lord through their transcendental intelligence.

Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that the wives of the brāhmaṇas experienced conjugal feelings toward Kṛṣṇa, as if He were their paramour; thus they could not be checked as they rushed to see Him.

prāyaḥ — repeatedly; śruta — heard; priya-tama — of their dearmost; udaya — the glories; karṇa-pūraiḥ — which were the ornaments of their ears; yasmin — in whom; nimagna — submerged; manasaḥ — their minds; tam — Him; atha — then; akṣi-randhraiḥ — through the apertures of their eyes; antaḥ — within; praveśya — making enter; su-ciram — for a long time; parirabhya — embracing; tāpam — their distress; prājñam — the inner consciousness; yathā — as; abhimatayaḥ — the functions of false ego; vijahuḥ — they gave up; nara-indra — O ruler of men.
Translation
O ruler of men, for a long time those brāhmaṇa ladies had heard about Kṛṣṇa, their beloved, and His glories had become the constant ornaments of their ears. Indeed, their minds were always absorbed in Him. Through the apertures of their eyes they now forced Him to enter within their hearts, and then they embraced Him within for a long time. In this way they finally gave up the pain of separation from Him, just as sages give up the anxiety of false ego by embracing their innermost consciousness.

Translation
Lord Kṛṣṇa, who witnesses the thoughts of all creatures, understood how those ladies had abandoned all worldly hopes and come there simply to see Him. Thus He addressed them as follows with a smile upon His face.

svāgataṁ vo mahā-bhāgā

Synonyms
su-āgatam — auspicious welcome; vaḥ — for you; mahā-bhāgāḥ — O fortunate ladies; āsyatām — please come sit; karavāma — I can do; kim — what; yat — because; naḥ — Us; didṛkṣayā — with the desire of seeing; prāptāḥ — you have come; upapannam — fitting; idam — this; hi — certainly; vaḥ — on your part.
Translation
[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:] Welcome, O most fortunate ladies. Please sit down and make yourselves comfortable. What can I do for you? That you have come here to see Me is most appropriate.
Purport
Just as Śrī Kṛṣṇa welcomed the gopīs who came to dance with Him at night, He similarly welcomed the brāhmaṇas’ wives, whose pure love for Him was proved by their overcoming many hindrances to see the Lord. The word upapannam indicates that although these ladies had rejected their husbands’ orders, their behavior was not at all inappropriate, since their husbands had obviously tried to obstruct their loving service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

nanv addhā mayi kurvanti

Synonyms
nanu — certainly; addhā — directly; mayi — unto Me; kurvanti — they perform; kuśalāḥ — those who are expert; sva-artha — their own true benefit; darśinaḥ — who perceive; ahaitukī — unmotivated; avyavahitām — uninterrupted; bhaktim — devotional service; ātma — to the soul; priye — who am most dear; yathā — properly.
Translation
Certainly expert personalities, who can see their own true interest, render unmotivated and uninterrupted devotional service directly unto Me, for I am most dear to the soul.
Purport
The Supreme Lord informed the brāhmaṇas’ wives that not only they but all people who recognize their true self-interest take to the spiritual process of loving service to the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa is ātma-priya, the real object of love for everyone. Although each individual has his own taste and freedom, ultimately every living being is a spiritual spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; thus everyone’s primary loving attraction is constitutionally meant for Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Loving service to the Lord should be ahaitukī, without personal motive, and avyavahitā, unobstructed by mental speculation, selfish desire or any quirk of time and circumstance.

prāṇa-buddhi-manaḥ-svātma
dārāpatya-dhanādayaḥ
yat-samparkāt priyā āsaṁs
tataḥ ko nv aparaḥ priyaḥ
Synonyms
prāṇa — one’s vital force; buddhi — intelligence; manaḥ — mind; sva — relatives; ātma — body; dāra — wife; apatya — children; dhana — wealth; ādayaḥ — and so forth; yat — with which (self); samparkāt — because of contact; priyāḥ — dear; āsan — have become; tataḥ — than that; kaḥ — what; nu — indeed; aparaḥ — other; priyaḥ — dear object.
Translation
It is only by contact with the self that one’s vital breath, intelligence, mind, friends, body, wife, children, wealth and so on are dear. Therefore what object can possibly be more dear than one’s own self?
Purport
The word yat-samparkāt in this verse refers to contact with the individual self and ultimately with the Supreme Self, the Lord, who is the origin of the individual living being. By developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one automatically becomes self-realized, and thus one’s vital strength, intelligence, mind, relatives, body, family and wealth all become enhanced and brilliant by the central influence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This happens because Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the optimum efficient conjunction of the individual self, who is pure consciousness, with the Supreme Self and supreme consciousness, Kṛṣṇa.

Translation
You should thus return to the sacrificial arena, because your husbands, the learned brāhmaṇas, are householders and need your assistance to finish their respective sacrifices.

Synonyms
śrī-patnyaḥ ūcuḥ — the wives of the brāhmaṇas said; mā — not; evam — like this; vibho — O almighty Lord; arhati — ought; bhavān — You; gaditum — to speak; nṛ-śaṁsam — harshly; satyam — true; kuruṣva — please make; nigamam — the promise given in the revealed scripture; tava — Your; pāda-mūlam — the base of the lotus feet; prāptāḥ — having obtained; vayam — we; tulasi-dāma — the garland of tulasī leaves; padā — from Your feet; avasṛṣṭam — fallen; keśaiḥ — upon our hair; nivoḍhum — in order to carry; atilaṅghya — rejecting; samasta — all; bandhūn — relations.
Translation
The wives of the brāhmaṇas replied: O almighty one, please do not speak such cruel words. Rather, You should fulfill Your promise that You always reciprocate with Your devotees in kind. Now that we have attained Your lotus feet, we simply wish to remain here in the forest so we may carry upon our heads the garlands of tulasī leaves that fall from Your lotus feet. We are ready to give up all material relationships.
Purport
Here the brāhmaṇas’ wives are saying something similar to what the gopīs say at the beginning of the rāsa dance (Bhāg. 10.29.31), when Lord Kṛṣṇa tells them to go home as well. Like this verse, the gopīs’ statement begins with the words maivaṁ vibho ’rhati bhavān gadituṁ nṛ-śaṁsam.
Nigama refers to the Vedic literature, which states that one who surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord does not return to this material world. Thus the brāhmaṇas’ wives appealed to the Lord that since they had surrendered to Him, it was unfair for Him to order them to return to their materialistic husbands.
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Lord Kṛṣṇa might have pointed out to the brāhmaṇas’ wives, “You young ladies are members of the aristocratic brāhmaṇa community, so how can you surrender at the feet of a mere cowherd boy?”
To this the ladies might have replied, “Since we have already surrendered at Your lotus feet, and since we desire to become Your servants, we are obviously not maintaining a false identification as members of the so-called brāhmaṇa community. You can easily ascertain this from our words.”
Lord Kṛṣṇa might have replied, “I am a cowherd boy, and My proper maidservants and girlfriends are the cowherd girls, the gopīs.”
The wives might have answered, “True, let them be so. Let them shine forth if You are embarrassed in front of Your relatives to make brāhmaṇa ladies Your maidservants. We certainly don’t want to embarrass You. We will not go to Your village but will rather remain in Vṛndāvana, like presiding deities of the forest. We simply desire to perfect our lives by even a slight trace of connection with You.”
Thus by the spiritual insight of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, we learn that the brāhmaṇas’ wives offered to remain at a distance and simply take the tulasī leaves that would fall from the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa or be crushed by the feet of His girlfriends when He would embrace them.
The ladies offered to carry these tulasī leaves upon their heads. Thus renouncing the desire to become Kṛṣṇa’s intimate girlfriends or maidservants (a position they knew was difficult to achieve), the young brāhmaṇa ladies begged to remain in Vṛndāvana forest. If the Lord had then asked “Then what will your family members say?” they would have replied “We have already transcended our so-called relatives because we are seeing You, the Supreme Lord, face to face.”

Translation
Our husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, other relatives and friends will no longer take us back, and how could anyone else be willing to give us shelter? Therefore, since we have thrown ourselves at Your lotus feet and have no other destination, please, O chastiser of enemies, grant our desire.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments as follows: “From their very youth the brāhmaṇas’ wives had heard about Lord Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, qualities and sweetness from the womenfolk of Vṛndāvana village, and also from the flower ladies, the betel-nut sellers and others. Consequently they always felt ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa and were indifferent to their household duties. Their husbands, seeing them as deviant, doubted them and avoided dealing with them as far as possible. Now the wives of the brāhmaṇas were ready to formally reject their so-called families and neighbors, and out of great agitation they were crying and placing their heads upon Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, offering obeisances. In this way, with choking voices, they spoke the above verse. They begged that Lord Kṛṣṇa bestow upon them the benediction that He be their only destination, that He, the chastiser of enemies, subdue all their enemies — those difficulties obstructing them from attaining the Lord.”
The wives of the brāhmaṇas simply wanted to serve Lord Kṛṣṇa, and this is pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness in ecstatic love of Godhead.

Translation
For you to remain in My bodily association would certainly not please people in this world, nor would it be the best way for you to increase your love for Me. Rather, you should fix your minds on Me, and very soon you will achieve Me.
Purport
The Lord pointed out that people in general would not appreciate a loving affair between Lord Kṛṣṇa, who superficially was appearing as a cowherd boy, and the wives from the brāhmaṇa community. Also, the brāhmaṇa ladies’ own devotion and love would increase most efficiently in separation. In other words, it would be best all around if they continued to fix their minds on Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus went on with the process they had been practicing throughout their lives. The Lord and His bona fide representative, the spiritual master, expertly engage the Lord’s devotees in different types of service so that all of them can quickly return to His lotus feet.

Purport
The wives of the brāhmaṇas obeyed Lord Kṛṣṇa’s order and returned to the sacrificial arena of their husbands, whereas the gopīs, although ordered by Kṛṣṇa to go home, remained in the forest to dance with Him through the full-moon night. Both the gopīs and the brāhmaṇas’ wives achieved pure love of Godhead.

Translation
One of the ladies had been forcibly kept back by her husband. When she heard the others describe the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, she embraced Him within her heart and gave up her material body, the basis of bondage to material activity.
Purport
The lady described here was especially devoted to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Upon giving up her material body, she immediately attained a spiritual body and left the sacrificial arena to join the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Translation
The brāhmaṇas then came to their senses and began to feel great remorse. They thought, “We have sinned, for we have denied the request of the two Lords of the universe, who deceptively appeared as ordinary human beings.”
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma did not try to deceive the brāhmaṇas: They straightforwardly requested food from them. Rather, the brāhmaṇas deceived themselves, as indicated by the Sanskrit word nṛ-viḍambayoḥ, which means that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma are bewildering for an ordinary human being who considers Them also to be human. Still, because the wives of the brāhmaṇas were great devotees of the Lord, the foolish brāhmaṇas received spiritual benefit and finally came to their senses.

dhik — to hell; janma — with the birth; naḥ — our; tri-vṛt — threefold (the first from the physical parents, the second at the time of brahminical initiation, and the third at the time of initiation into the performances of Vedic sacrifice); yat tat — whatever; dhik — to hell; vratam — with our vow (of celibacy); dhik — to hell; bahu-jñatām — with our extensive knowledge; dhik — to hell; kulam — with our aristocratic lineage; dhik — to hell; kriyā-dākṣyam — with our expertise in ritualistic activities; vimukhaḥ — inimical; ye — who; tu — however; adhokṣaje — to the transcendental Personality of Godhead.
Translation
[The brāhmaṇas said:] To hell with our threefold birth, our vow of celibacy and our extensive learning! To hell with our aristocratic background and our expertise in the rituals of sacrifice! These are all condemned because we were inimical to the transcendental Personality of Godhead.
Purport
As explained in the definitions above, the words tri-vṛḍ janma, or “threefold birth,” refer to 1) physical birth, 2) brahminical initiation and 3) initiation into the performance of Vedic sacrifice. Everything is useless if one is ignorant of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Translation
Just see the unlimited love these women have developed for Lord Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual master of the entire universe! This love has broken for them the very bonds of death — their attachment to family life.
Purport
Superficially, the husbands, fathers, fathers-in-law and so on were the ladies’ gurus, or teachers. Yet the women had become perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whereas the men had fallen into the darkness of ignorance.
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, upon returning home the ladies showed transcendental ecstatic symptoms, such as trembling of the body, shedding of tears, standing of the bodily hairs on end, discoloration of the complexion, crying out “O pleasure of my life, O Kṛṣṇa!” with faltering words, and so forth.
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī goes on to state that while one may object that it is not fitting for a woman to love anyone other than her husband, here the husbands themselves point out that they are gurus only in imitation of the Supreme Lord, who is jagad-guru, the universal teacher and spiritual master. The husbands noted that the women, having perfected their transcendental attachment for Kṛṣṇa, did not have even a trace of attachment left for home, husband, children and so forth. Therefore from that day on the husbands accepted those ladies as their worshipable spiritual masters and no longer thought of them as their wives or property.

Synonyms
na — there is not; āsām — on their part; dvijāti-saṁskāraḥ — the purificatory rituals pertaining to the twice-born classes of society; na — nor; nivāsaḥ — residence; gurau — in the āśrama of a spiritual master (that is, training as a brahmacārī); api — even; na — no; tapaḥ — execution of austerities; na — no; ātma-mīmāṁsā — philosophical inquiry into the reality of the self; na — no; śaucam — rituals of cleanliness; na — no; kriyāḥ — ritualistic activities; śubhāḥ — pious; tathā api — nevertheless; hi — indeed; uttamaḥ-śloke — whose glories are chanted by the exalted mantras of the Vedas; kṛṣṇe — for Lord Kṛṣṇa; yoga-īśvara-īśvare — the supreme master of all masters of mystic power; bhaktiḥ — pure devotional service; dṛḍhā — firm; na — not; ca — on the other hand; asmākam — of us; saṁskāra-ādi-matām — who possess such purification and so forth; api — even though.
Translation
These women have never undergone the purificatory rites of the twice-born classes, nor have they lived as brahmacārīs in the āśrama of a spiritual master, nor have they executed austerities, speculated on the nature of the self, followed the formalities of cleanliness or engaged in pious rituals. Nevertheless, they have firm devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa, whose glories are chanted by the exalted hymns of the Vedas and who is the supreme master of all masters of mystic power. We, on the other hand, have no such devotion for the Lord, although we have executed all these processes.
Purport
According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the husbands were not aware that their wives had occasionally associated with residents of Vṛndāvana, such as the flower ladies, and had heard about the beauty and qualities of Kṛṣṇa. The brāhmaṇas were astonished at their wives’ loving devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa, not realizing that this devotion had developed as a result of hearing and chanting about the Lord in the association of His pure devotees.

Translation

Translation
Otherwise, why would the supreme controller — whose every desire is already fulfilled and who is the master of liberation and all other transcendental benedictions — enact this pretense with us, who are always to be controlled by Him?
Purport
Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, He humbly sent His cowherd boyfriends to beg food from the brāhmaṇas. In so doing, He exposed the brāhmaṇas’ foolish arrogance and established the glories of His own transcendental beauty by attracting their very wives to surrender at His lotus feet.

The supreme master of the goddess of fortune herself obviously does not have to beg for food, as pointed out here by the brāhmaṇas, who are finally manifesting real spiritual intelligence.

Translation
All the aspects of sacrifice — the auspicious place and time, the various items of paraphernalia, the Vedic hymns, the prescribed rituals, the priests and sacrificial fires, the demigods, the patron of the sacrifice, the sacrificial offering and the pious results obtained — all are simply manifestations of His opulences. Yet even though we had heard that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, the Lord of all mystic controllers, had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty, we were so foolish that we could not recognize Śrī Kṛṣṇa to be none other than Him.

Translation
Thus reflecting on the sin they had committed by neglecting Lord Kṛṣṇa, they became very eager to see Him. But being afraid of King Kaṁsa, they did not dare go to Vraja.
Purport
Realizing their offense against Lord Kṛṣṇa, and finally appreciating His almighty position, the brāhmaṇas naturally wanted to rush to Vraja and surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord. But they were afraid that Kaṁsa would certainly kill them when his spies reported that they had gone to Kṛṣṇa. The brāhmaṇas’ wives were absorbed in ecstatic Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus went to Kṛṣṇa anyway, just as the gopīs, simply to dance with the Lord, traveled in the dead of night through a forest inhabited by wild animals. But the brāhmaṇas were not on such an advanced platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus, overcome by fear of Kaṁsa, could not see the Lord face to face.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Brāhmaṇas’ Wives Blessed.”
