CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN

The Song of the Bee
This chapter describes how Uddhava, on the order of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, delivered the Lord’s message to the gopīs, consoled them and then returned to Mathurā.
When the young maidens of Vraja saw lotus-eyed Uddhava, who wore a yellow garment and attractive earrings, they were astonished at how much he resembled Kṛṣṇa. Thinking “Who is this?” they approached and encircled him. When they realized that Kṛṣṇa must have sent him, they brought him to a secluded place where he could speak to them confidentially.
The gopīs then began to remember the pastimes they had enjoyed with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and putting aside all ordinary propriety and shyness, they loudly wept. One gopī, while deeply meditating on Her association with Kṛṣṇa, noticed a bumblebee before Her. Imagining the bee to be a messenger from Him, She said, “Just as bees wander among various flowers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa has abandoned the young girls of Vraja and developed affection for other women.” The gopī continued to speak in this way, contrasting Her own supposed ill fortune to Her rival lovers’ good fortune, all the while glorifying the names, forms, qualities and pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. She then declared that although Kṛṣṇa may have abandoned the gopīs, they could not possibly stop remembering Him for even a moment.
Uddhava tried to console the damsels of Vraja, who were so anxious to see Kṛṣṇa once again. Uddhava explained, “While ordinary persons must perform many pious deeds to qualify as servants of Lord Kṛṣṇa, you simple cowherd girls are so extremely fortunate that the Lord has favored you with the very highest degree of pure devotion for Him.” Uddhava then related to them the Lord’s message.
Quoting Lord Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava said, “I am the Supreme Soul and supreme shelter of all. By My potencies I create, maintain and destroy the cosmos. I am indeed most dear to you gopīs, but to increase your attraction for Me and intensify your remembrance of Me, I left you. After all, when a woman’s beloved is far away, she fixes her mind upon him constantly. By incessantly remembering Me, you are sure to regain My association without delay.’”
The gopīs then asked Uddhava, “Is Kṛṣṇa happy now that Kaṁsa is dead and He can enjoy the company of His family members and the women of Mathurā? Does He still remember all the pastimes He enjoyed with us, such as the rāsa dance? Will Śrī Kṛṣṇa once again appear before us and give us ecstasy, just as Lord Indra, with his rain, gives life back to the forests aggrieved by the summer heat? Although we know that the greatest happiness comes from renunciation, we simply cannot stop hoping to attain Kṛṣṇa, for the marks of His lotus feet are still present throughout the land of Vraja, reminding us of His graceful gait, generous smiles and gentle talks. By all these our hearts have been stolen away.”
Having said this, the gopīs loudly chanted Lord Kṛṣṇa’s names, calling out, “O Govinda, please come and destroy our suffering!” Uddhava then pacified the gopīs with statements that dispelled their pain of separation, and they in turn worshiped him as nondifferent from Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Uddhava stayed in the district of Vraja for several months, giving pleasure to the residents by reminding them about Kṛṣṇa in various ways. Very satisfied at seeing the extent of the gopīs’ love for the Lord, he declared, “These cowherd girls have perfected their lives by coming to the platform of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, even Lord Brahmā is inferior to them. The goddess of fortune herself, who always resides on Kṛṣṇa’s chest, could not get the same mercy as that which the gopīs obtained during the rāsa dance, when Kṛṣṇa embraced their necks with His mighty arms. What, then, to speak of other women! Indeed, I would consider myself most fortunate to take birth as even a bush or creeper that would sometimes be touched by the dust of these gopīs’ lotus feet.”
Finally, Uddhava entreated Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherd men for permission to go back to Mathurā. Nanda presented him with many gifts and prayed to Uddhava for the ability to always remember Kṛṣṇa. Returning to Mathurā, Uddhava offered Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa and King Ugrasena the gifts sent by Nanda Mahārāja and described to them everything he had experienced in Vraja.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: The young women of Vraja became astonished upon seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s servant, who had long arms, whose eyes resembled a newly grown lotus, who wore a yellow garment and a lotus garland, and whose lotuslike face glowed with brightly polished earrings. “Who is this handsome man?” the gopīs asked. “Where has he come from, and whom does he serve? He’s wearing Kṛṣṇa’s clothes and ornaments!” Saying this, the gopīs eagerly crowded around Uddhava, whose shelter was the lotus feet of Lord Uttamaḥśloka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Bowing their heads in humility, the gopīs duly honored Uddhava with their shy, smiling glances and pleasing words. They took him to a quiet place, seated him comfortably and began to question him, for they recognized him to be a messenger from Kṛṣṇa, the master of the goddess of fortune.
Purport
The chaste gopīs were enlivened to see that a messenger had come from Kṛṣṇa. As Uddhava will discover during his stay in Vṛndāvana, the unique gopīs could not think of anything but their beloved Kṛṣṇa.

Translation
We see nothing else He might consider worth remembering in these cow pastures of Vraja. Indeed, the bonds of affection for one’s family members are difficult to break, even for a sage.

अन्येष्वर्थकृता मैत्री यावदर्थविडम्बनम् ।

anyeṣv artha-kṛtā maitrī
yāvad-artha-viḍambanam
pumbhiḥ strīṣu kṛtā yadvat
sumanaḥsv iva ṣaṭpadaiḥ
Synonyms
anyeṣu — toward others; artha — for some motivation; kṛtā — manifested; maitrī — friendship; yāvat — for as long; artha — (as one is fulfilling his) motive; viḍambanam — pretense; pumbhiḥ — by men; strīṣu — for women; kṛtā — shown; yadvat — as much; sumanaḥsu — for flowers; iva — as; ṣaṭ-padaiḥ — by bees.
Translation
The friendship shown toward others — those who are not family members — is motivated by personal interest, and thus it is a pretense that lasts only until one’s purpose is fulfilled. Such friendship is just like the interest men take in women, or bees in flowers.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains here that attractive women, like flowers, possess beauty, fragrance, tenderness, charm and so on. And as bees drink only once of a flower’s nectar and then leave it for another, fickle men abandon beautiful and devoted women to pursue other pleasures. This tendency is condemned here by the gopīs, who gave their hearts completely to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The gopīs wanted only to exhibit their charms for Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure, and in the pain of separation they questioned the motives of His friendship with them.
These are the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Both Lord Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs are completely liberated souls engaged in spiritual loving affairs. By contrast, our so-called loving affairs, being perverted reflections of the perfect loving relationships in the spiritual world, are polluted with lust, greed, pride and so on. Like all liberated souls, the gopīs — and certainly Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself — are eternally free of these lower qualities, and their intense loving affairs are motivated exclusively by unalloyed devotion.

iti — thus; gopyaḥ — the gopīs; hi — indeed; govinde — on Govinda; gata — focusing; vāk — their speech; kāya — bodies; mānasaḥ — and minds; kṛṣṇa-dūte — the messenger of Kṛṣṇa; samāyāte — having arrived and joined them; uddhave — Uddhava; tyakta — putting aside; laukikāḥ — worldly affairs; gāyantyaḥ — singing; priya — of their beloved; karmāṇi — about the activities; rudantyaḥ — crying; ca — and; gata-hriyaḥ — forgetting all shyness; tasya — His; saṁsmṛtya saṁsmṛtya — intensely remembering again and again; yāni — which; kaiśora — of youth; bālyayoḥ — and childhood.
Translation
Thus speaking, the gopīs, whose words, bodies and minds were fully dedicated to Lord Govinda, put aside all their regular work now that Kṛṣṇa’s messenger, Śrī Uddhava, had arrived among them. Constantly remembering the activities their beloved Kṛṣṇa had performed in His childhood and youth, they sang about them and cried without shame.
Purport
The word bālyayoḥ here indicates that ever since their childhood, the gopīs had been completely in love with Kṛṣṇa. Thus even though social custom dictated that they not reveal their love to others, they forgot all external considerations and openly wept before Kṛṣṇa’s messenger, Uddhava.

Synonyms
kācit — one (of the gopīs); madhu-karam — a honeybee; dṛṣṭvā — seeing; dhyāyantī — while meditating; kṛṣṇa-saṅgamam — on Her association with Kṛṣṇa; priya — by Her beloved; prasthāpitam — sent; dūtam — a messenger; kalpayitvā — imagining it; idam — the following; abravīt — spoke.
Translation
One of the gopīs, while meditating on Her previous association with Kṛṣṇa, saw a honeybee before Her and imagined it to be a messenger sent by Her beloved. Thus She spoke as follows.
Purport
Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is referred to in this verse as kācit, “a certain gopī.” To establish that this particular gopī is in fact Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī quotes the following verses from the Agni Purāṇa:
gopyaḥ papracchur ūṣasi
kṛṣṇānucaram uddhavam
harī-līlā-vihārāṁś ca
tatraikāṁ rādhikāṁ vinā
rādhā tad-bhāva-saṁlīnā
vāsanāyā virāmitā
sakhībhiḥ sābhyadhāc chuddha-
vijñāna-guṇa-jṛmbhitam
ijyānte-vāsināṁ veda
caramāṁśa-vibhāvanaiḥ
“At dawn the gopīs inquired from Kṛṣṇa’s servant, Uddhava, about the Lord’s pastimes and recreation. Only Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, immersed in thought of Kṛṣṇa, withdrew Her interest in the talks. Then Rādhā, who is worshiped by the residents of Her Vṛndāvana village, spoke up in the midst of Her girlfriends. Her words were full of pure transcendental knowledge and expressed the ultimate portion of the Vedas.”
In the Bhagavad-gītā (15.15) Lord Kṛṣṇa states, vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ: “By all the Vedas, I am to be known.” To know Kṛṣṇa is to love Kṛṣṇa, and thus Rādhārāṇī, by Her own example and words, revealed Her supreme love for the Lord.
Having quoted the above verses from the Agni Purāṇa, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī also quotes the following from the Nṛsiṁha-tāpanī Upaniṣad (Pūrva-khaṇḍa 2.4): yaṁ sarve devā namanti mumukṣavo brahma-vādinaś ca. “All the demigods and all the transcendental philosophers who desire liberation bow down to the Supreme Lord.” We should follow suit.

Synonyms
gopī uvāca — the gopī said; madhupa — O bumblebee; kitava — of a cheater; bandho — O friend; mā spṛśa — please do not touch; aṅghrim — the feet; sapatnyāḥ — of the lover who is our rival; kuca — the breast; vilulita — fallen from; mālā — from the garland; kuṅkuma — with the red cosmetic; śmaśrubhiḥ — with the whiskers; naḥ — our; vahatu — let Him bring; madhu-patiḥ — the Lord of the Madhu dynasty; tat — His; māninīnām — to the women; prasādam — mercy or kindness; yadu-sadasi — in the royal assembly of the Yadus; viḍambyam — an object of ridicule or contempt; yasya — whose; dūtaḥ — messenger; tvam — you; īdṛk — such.
Translation
The gopī said: O honeybee, O friend of a cheater, don’t touch My feet with your whiskers, which are smeared with the kuṅkuma that rubbed onto Kṛṣṇa’s garland when it was crushed by the breasts of a rival lover! Let Kṛṣṇa satisfy the women of Mathurā. One who sends a messenger like you will certainly be ridiculed in the Yadus’ assembly.
Purport
Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī indirectly chastised Kṛṣṇa by chastising the bumblebee, which She took for His messenger. She addressed the bumblebee as madhupa, “one who drinks the nectar (of flowers),” and She addressed Kṛṣṇa as madhu-pati, “the Lord of Madhu.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that this and the following nine verses exemplify ten kinds of impulsive speech spoken by a lover. This verse illustrates the qualities of prajalpa, as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse from his Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.182):
asūyerṣyā-mada-yujā
yo ’vadhīraṇa-mudrayā
priyasyākauśalodgāraḥ
prajalpaḥ sa tu kīrtyate
“Prajalpa is speech that denigrates the tactlessness of one’s lover with expressions of disrespect. It is spoken in a mood of envy, jealousy and pride.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word kitava-bandho expresses envy; the phrase from sapatnyāḥ to naḥ, jealousy; the phrase mā spṛśa aṅghrim, pride; and the phrase from vahatu to prasādam, disrespect, while the phrase from yadu-sadasi to the end of the verse decries Kṛṣṇa’s tactless treatment of Rādhārāṇī.

Translation
After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kṛṣṇa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmā willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.
Purport
In this verse Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī continues to compare Śrī Kṛṣṇa to the bumblebee, and in Her distress She states that the reason the goddess of fortune is constantly devoted to His lotus feet must be that she has been fooled by Kṛṣṇa’s promises. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this statement of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s illustrates parijalpa, as described in Śrī Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.184):
prabhor nidayatā-śāṭhya-
cāpalyādy-upapādanāt
sva-vicakṣaṇatā-vyaktir
bhaṅgyā syāt parijalpitam
“Parijalpa is that speech which, through various devices, shows one’s own cleverness by exposing the mercilessness, duplicity, unreliability and so on of one’s Lord.”

Synonyms
kim — why; iha — here; bahu — much; ṣaṭ-aṅghre — O bee (six-footed one); gāyasi — are singing; tvam — you; yadūnām — of the Yadus; adhipatim — about the master; agṛhāṇām — who have no home; agrataḥ — in front of; naḥ — us; purāṇam — old; vijaya — of Arjuna; sakha — of the friend; sakhīnām — for the friends; gīyatām — should be sung; tat — of Him; prasaṅgaḥ — the topics; kṣapita — relieved; kuca — of whose breasts; rujaḥ — the pain; te — they; kalpayanti — will provide; iṣṭam — the charity you desire; iṣṭāḥ — His beloveds.
Translation
O bee, why do you sing here so much about the Lord of the Yadus, in front of us homeless people? These topics are old news to us. Better you sing about that friend of Arjuna in front of His new girlfriends, the burning desire in whose breasts He has now relieved. Those ladies will surely give you the charity you are begging.
Purport
With the words agṛhāṇām agrato naḥ, Rādhārāṇī laments that even though She and the other gopīs gave up their homes to love Kṛṣṇa in a conjugal relationship, the Lord left them and became a prince in the great royal city of the Yadus. Besides meaning “Arjuna, the victor,” the word vijaya also directly indicates Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is always victorious in His endeavors, and besides meaning “old (news),” the word purāṇam also indicates that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is glorified in the ancient Vedic scriptures of that name.
In this verse we observe in Rādhārāṇī’s mood the seed of jealous anger, which arises from an apparent disdain for Kṛṣṇa, accompanied by a sarcastic sidelong glance directed toward Him. Thus this verse fits the following description of vijalpa from the Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.186):
vyaktayāsūyayā gūḍha-
māna-mudrāntarālayā
agha-dviṣi kaṭākṣoktir
vijalpo viduṣāṁ mataḥ
“According to learned authorities, vijalpa is sarcastic speech that is addressed to the killer of Agha and that openly expresses jealousy while at the same time hinting at one’s angry pride.”

divi — in the heavenly region; bhuvi — on the earth; ca — and; rasāyām — in the subterranean sphere; kāḥ — what; striyaḥ — women; tat — by Him; durāpāḥ — unobtainable; kapaṭa — deceptive; rucira — charming; hāsa — with smiles; bhrū — of whose eyebrows; vijṛmbhasya — the arching; yāḥ — who; syuḥ — become; caraṇa — of the feet; rajaḥ — the dust; upāste — worships; yasya — whose; bhūtiḥ — the goddess of fortune, wife of Lord Nārāyaṇa; vayam — we; kā — who; api ca — nevertheless; kṛpaṇa-pakṣe — for those who are wretched; hi — indeed; uttamaḥ-śloka — the Supreme Lord, who is glorified by the most sublime prayers; śabdaḥ — the name.
Translation
In heaven, on earth or in the subterranean sphere, what women are unavailable to Him? He simply arches His eyebrows and smiles with deceptive charm, and they all become His. The supreme goddess herself worships the dust of His feet, so what is our position in comparison? But at least those who are wretched can chant His name, Uttamaḥśloka.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that Rādhārāṇī’s speech, expressing all the feelings of a disappointed lover, indicates an intensity of love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa surpassing even that of the goddess of fortune. While all the gopīs are perfectly compatible with Śrī Kṛṣṇa in terms of their beauty, temperament and so on, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is especially so. In Her forlorn state, Rādhārāṇī indicates to Kṛṣṇa, “You are called Uttamaḥśloka because You are merciful to the wretched and fallen, but if You would be merciful to Me, then You would actually deserve this exalted name.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further points out that in this verse, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī expresses Her spite born of pride, accuses Kṛṣṇa of being a cheater and finds fault with His behavior. Thus this verse contains speech known as ujjalpa, as described in the following verse of the Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.188):
hareḥ kuhakatākhyānaṁ
garva-garbhitayerṣyayā
sāsūyaś ca tad-ākṣepo
dhīrair ujjalpa īryate
“The declaration of Lord Hari’s duplicitous nature in a mood of spite born of pride, together with jealously spoken insults directed against Him, has been termed ujjalpa by the wise.”

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this verse illustrates the qualities of sañjalpa, as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse of his Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.190):
solluṇṭhayā gahanayā
kayāpy ākṣepa-mudrayā
tasyākṛta-jñatādy-uktiḥ
sañjalpaḥ kathito budhaiḥ
“The learned describe sañjalpa as that speech which decries with deep irony and insulting gestures the beloved’s ungratefulness and so on.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word ādi, “and so on,” implies the perception in one’s lover of hardheartedness, of an inimical attitude and of a complete lack of love.

Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahārāja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can’t give up talking about Him.

In Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains the meaning of this verse as follows: “[Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī said to the bee,] ‘You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about Kṛṣṇa — how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have all heard this from our grandmother Paurṇamāsī. She has informed us that Kṛṣṇa was born in a kṣatriya family previous to this birth and was known as Rāmacandra. In that birth, instead of killing Vāli, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a kṣatriya, He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord Rāmacandra, as a kṣatriya, should have fought with Vāli face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a kṣatriya. Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of Sītā that He converted Śūrpaṇakhā, the sister of Rāvaṇa, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. Śūrpaṇakhā proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a kṣatriya He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget Sītādevī and converted Śūrpaṇakhā into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a kṣatriya, He took birth as a brāhmaṇa boy known as Vāmanadeva and asked charity from Bali Mahārāja. Bali Mahārāja was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet Kṛṣṇa as Vāmanadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the Pātāla kingdom. We know all about Kṛṣṇa and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: in spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.’”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that this speech of Rādhārāṇī’s is called avajalpa, as described by Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse from the Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.192):
harau kāṭhinya-kāmitva-
dhaurtyād āsakty-ayogyatā
yatra serṣyā-bhiyevoktā
so ’vajalpaḥ satāṁ mataḥ
“Saintly persons have concluded that when a lover, impelled by jealousy and fear, declares that Lord Hari is unworthy of her attachment because of His harshness, lustiness and dishonesty, such speech is called avajalpa.”

yat — whose; anucarita — constantly performed activities; līlā — of such pastimes; karṇa — for the ears; pīyūṣa — of the nectar; vipruṭ — of a drop; sakṛt — just once; adana — by the partaking; vidhūta — removed entirely; dvandva — of duality; dharmāḥ — their propensities; vinaṣṭāḥ — ruined; sapadi — immediately; gṛha — their homes; kuṭumbam — and families; dīnam — wretched; utsṛjya — rejecting; dīnāḥ — becoming themselves wretched; bahavaḥ — many persons; iha — here (in Vṛndāvana); vihaṅgāḥ — (like) birds; bhikṣu — of begging; caryām — the livelihood; caranti — they pursue.
Translation
To hear about the pastimes that Kṛṣṇa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Vṛndāvana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.
Purport
Material duality is based on falsely thinking, “This is mine, and that is yours,” or “This is our country, and that is yours,” or “This is my family, and that is yours,” and so on. In fact, there is one Absolute Truth, in which we all exist and to whom everything belongs. His beauty and pleasure are also absolute and infinite, and if one actually hears about this Absolute Truth, called Kṛṣṇa, one’s dedication to the illusion of mundane duality is spoiled.
According to the ācāryas, and certainly in accord with Sanskrit grammar, the last two words of the second line of this text may also be divided dharma-avinaṣṭāḥ. Then the entire line becomes part of a single compound, the meaning of which is that hearing about Kṛṣṇa cleanses one of irreligious duality and thus one is not vanquished (avinaṣṭa) by material illusion. The word dīnāḥ is then given the alternate reading of dhīrāḥ, meaning that one becomes spiritually sober and thus gives up attachment to fleeting material relationships. The word vihaṅgāḥ, “birds,” would in this case refer to swans, the symbol of essential discrimination.
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes Rūpa Gosvāmī as follows in connection with this verse:
bhaṅgyā tyāgaucitī tasya
khagānām api khedanāt
yatra sānuśayaṁ proktā
tad bhaved abhijalpitam
“When a lover indirectly states with remorse that her beloved is fit to be given up, such speech, uttered like the plaintive crying of a bird, is called abhijalpa.” (Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi 14.194)

In Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains the context of this verse: “While Rādhārāṇī was talking with the bee and the bee was flying hither and thither, it all of a sudden disappeared from Her sight. She was in full mourning due to separation from Kṛṣṇa and felt ecstasy by talking with the bee. But as soon as the bee disappeared, She became almost mad, thinking that the messenger-bee might have returned to Kṛṣṇa to inform Him all about Her talking against Him. ‘Kṛṣṇa must be very sorry to hear it,’ She thought. In this way She was overwhelmed by another type of ecstasy.
“In the meantime, the bee, flying hither and thither, appeared before Her again. She thought, ‘Kṛṣṇa is still kind to Me. In spite of the messenger’s carrying disruptive messages, He is so kind that He has again sent the bee to take Me to Him.’ Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was very careful this time not to say anything against Kṛṣṇa.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the goddess of fortune, Śrī, has the power to assume many different forms. Thus when Kṛṣṇa enjoys other women, she stays on His chest in the form of a golden line. When He is not consorting with other women, she puts aside this form and gives Him pleasure in Her naturally beautiful form of a young woman.
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this statement of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s expresses pratijalpa, as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:
dustyaja-dvandva-bhāve ’smin
prāptir nārhety anuddhatam
dūta-sammānanenoktaṁ
yatra sa pratijalpakaḥ
“When the lover humbly states that although she is unworthy of attaining her beloved she cannot give up hoping for a conjugal relationship with Him, such words, spoken with respect for her beloved’s message, are called pratijalpa.” (Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi 14.198)
Here Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī has given up Her harsh feelings and humbly acknowledges the greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

O Uddhava! It is indeed regrettable that Kṛṣṇa resides in Mathurā. Does He remember His father’s household affairs and His friends, the cowherd boys? O great soul! Does He ever talk about us, His maidservants? When will He lay on our heads His aguru-scented hand?
Purport
The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Ādi 6.68).
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī writes very poetically, with deep spiritual insight, about the emotions expressed in this and the previous nine verses. He interprets Rādhārāṇī’s feelings as follows:
Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī thought, “Since Kṛṣṇa was once satisfied in Vraja but left for Mathurā City, won’t He also develop a desire to leave that place and go somewhere else? Mathurā is so close to Vṛndāvana that it’s possible He may even come back here.
“Kṛṣṇa is the son of a respectable gentleman, Nanda Mahārāja, so He must be staying in Mathurā because of His sense of obligation to His father, who authorized His going there. On the other hand, while Nanda’s whole life is dedicated exclusively to Kṛṣṇa, Nanda is so innocent that he allowed himself to be tricked by the Yadus, who brought Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Kṛṣṇa must be thinking, ‘Alas, alas! Since even My father could not bring Me back to Vraja, what can I do to return there?’ Thus Kṛṣṇa must be impatient to come back here, and so He has sent you, a messenger.
“It is only because Nanda is so innocent that he allowed his son to leave. If Nanda had allowed Kṛṣṇa’s mother, the queen of Vraja, to do so, she would have climbed onto Akrūra’s chariot and, holding her son by the neck, gone off to Mathurā with Him, followed by all the gopīs. But this was not possible.
“Ever since Kṛṣṇa left, Nanda has been stunned by separation from Him, and Nanda’s treasury rooms, storehouses, kitchens, sleeping quarters, opulent houses and so on are now vacant. Unswept and uncleansed, they are littered with grass, dust, leaves and cobwebs. Does Kṛṣṇa ever remember His father’s houses? And does He sometimes remember Subala and His other friends, who are now lying stunned in other neglected houses?
“The women in Mathurā who now associate with Kṛṣṇa cannot know how to serve Him in the way that pleases Him most. When they see He is not satisfied and ask how they can make Him happy, does He tell them about us gopīs?
“Kṛṣṇa must tell them, ‘You city ladies cannot please Me as much as the gopīs of Vraja. They are most expert in stringing flower garlands, perfuming their bodies with ointments, playing various rhythms and melodies on stringed instruments, dancing and singing in the rāsa performance, displaying their beauty, charm and cleverness, and skillfully playing at questions and answers. They are especially expert in the pastimes of meeting one’s lover and showing jealous anger and other signs of pure love and affection.’ Surely Kṛṣṇa must know this. Therefore He’ll probably tell the women of Mathurā, ‘My dear women of the Yadu clan, please go back to your families. I no longer desire to associate with you. In fact, I’m going back to Vraja early tomorrow morning.’
“When will Kṛṣṇa speak like this and come back here to place His hand, fragrant with aguru, on our heads? Then He will console us, saying, ‘O beloveds of My heart, I swear to you that I will never abandon you again and go elsewhere. Indeed, I have not been able to find anyone in all the three worlds with even a trace of your good qualities.’”
Thus Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī interprets the feelings of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The ācārya further explains that the present text displays the speech called sujalpa, as described by Rūpa Gosvāmī:
yatrārjavāt sa-gāmbhīryaṁ
sa-dainyaṁ saha-cāpalam
sotkaṇṭhaṁ ca hariḥ pṛṣṭaḥ
sa sujalpo nigadyate
“When, out of honest sincerity, a lover questions Śrī Hari with gravity, humility, unsteadiness and eagerness, such speech is known as sujalpa.” (Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi 14.200)
Concluding this section of Chapter Forty-seven, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that there are ten divisions of divine madness (divyonmāda), which are expressed by the ten divisions of citra-jalpa, or variegated speech. Such divine madness is shown in the special pastime of bewilderment, which is itself part of the supreme bliss, mahā-bhāva, of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The ācārya quotes the following verses from Rūpa Gosvāmī’s Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi (14.174, 178-80) to explain these ecstasies:
prāyo vṛndāvaneśvaryāṁ
mohano ’yam udañcati
etasya mohanākhyasya
gatiṁ kām apy upeyuṣaḥ
bhramābhā kāpi vaicitrī
divyonmāda itīryate
udghūrṇā citra-jalpādyās
tad-bhedā bahavo matāḥ
preṣṭhasya suhṛd-āloke
gūḍha-roṣābhijṛmbhitaḥ
bhūri-bhāva-mayo jalpo
yas tīvrotkaṇṭhitāntimaḥ
citra-jalpo daśāṅgo ’yaṁ
prajalpaḥ parijalpitaḥ
vijalpo ’jjalpa-sañjalpaḥ
avajalpo ’bhijalpitam
ājalpaḥ pratijalpaś ca
sujalpaś ceti kīrtitaḥ
“It is virtually only within the princess of Vṛndāvana [Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī] that the ecstasy of bewilderment arises. She has attained to a special stage of this bewilderment, a wonderful state that resembles delusion. Known as divyonmāda, it has many aspects, which come and go unsteadily, and one of these manifestations is citra-jalpa. This talk, induced by Her seeing Her beloved’s friend, is filled with covered anger and comprises many different ecstasies. It culminates in Her intense, anxious eagerness.
“This citra-jalpa has ten divisions, known as prajalpa, parijalpa, vijalpa, ujjalpa, sañjalpa, avajalpa, abhijalpa, ājalpa, pratijalpa and sujalpa.”
Finally, some authorities say that Kṛṣṇa Himself, eager to drink the sweetness of His beloved’s speech, assumed the form of the messenger bee.

Translation
By your great fortune you have left your sons, husbands, bodily comforts, relatives and homes in favor of the supreme male, who is known as Kṛṣṇa.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the gopīs gave up their sense of possessiveness toward these objects. History shows that the gopīs remained in Vṛndāvana, living in their houses with their families. However, unlike ordinary persons, they entirely renounced the egoistical sense of possession of sons, husbands and so on. They never tried to enjoy them but rather gave their whole heart and mind to the Supreme Lord, as recommended in the great religious scriptures of the world. Following the example of the gopīs, we should love the Supreme Lord with all of our heart, soul and might.

sarvātma-bhāvo ’dhikṛto

Synonyms
sarva-ātma — wholehearted; bhāvaḥ — love; adhikṛtaḥ — claimed by right; bhavatīnām — by you; adhokṣaje — for the transcendental Lord; viraheṇa — through this mood of separation; mahā-bhāgāḥ — O most glorious ones; mahān — great; me — to me; anugrahaḥ — mercy; kṛtaḥ — done.
Translation
You have rightfully claimed the privilege of unalloyed love for the transcendental Lord, O most glorious gopīs. Indeed, by exhibiting your love for Kṛṣṇa in separation from Him, you have shown me great mercy.
Purport
The gopīs showed not only Uddhava but the whole world the joy of love of Godhead, and thus they bestowed their mercy on everyone. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, because their loving devotion was executed in an appropriate way, their love brought the Supreme Lord under their control. Still, to show the intensity of their love, He apparently left them. But now He again manifested Himself among them, becoming spiritually present through their intense devotion.

khaṁ vāyv-agnir jalaṁ mahī
tathāhaṁ ca manaḥ-prāṇa-

Synonyms
śrī-bhagavān uvāca — the Supreme Lord said; bhavatīnām — of you women; viyogaḥ — separation; me — from Me; na — is not; hi — indeed; sarva-ātmanā — from the Soul of all existence; kvacit — ever; yathā — as; bhūtāni — the physical elements; bhūteṣu — in all created beings; kham — the ether; vāyu-agniḥ — air and fire; jalam — water; mahī — earth; tathā — so; aham — I; ca — and; manaḥ — of the mind; prāṇa — vital air; bhūta — material elements; indriya — bodily senses; guṇa — and of the primal modes of nature; āśrayaḥ — present as their shelter.
Translation
The Supreme Lord said: You are never actually separated from Me, for I am the Soul of all creation. Just as the elements of nature — ether, air, fire, water and earth — are present in every created thing, so I am present within everyone’s mind, life air and senses, and also within the physical elements and the modes of material nature.
Purport
According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the apparently philosophical language of the Lord’s statement conceals a deeper meaning. The Supreme Lord was secretly telling the gopīs that He, by way of reciprocating their special love for Him, was present with them, not only as the Soul of all creation but also as their special lover. In this sense of the verse, the word guṇa indicates the gopīs’ special divine qualities, which attracted Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the word sarvātmanā, which we have here translated in reference to Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself (corresponding to the word me, which is also in the instrumental case), is also understood in the sense of sarvathā, or “completely.” In other words, although in one sense Lord Kṛṣṇa was absent, He could never be completely absent, since in His spiritual form He is always in the hearts and minds of the gopīs.
In Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and other books, Śrīla Prabhupāda has elaborately explained that the reason Lord Kṛṣṇa separated Himself from the gopīs was to intensify their love for Him and, as Uddhava noted, to bless other devotees by revealing to them the intensity of the gopīs’ love. In fact, the Lord was spiritually present with the gopīs, since they are His eternal associates.
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further points out that foolish persons will conclude that Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s use of philosophical language meant that the Lord was trying to bring the gopīs to the point of liberation by explaining basic points of Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy. In truth, the gopīs are the most exalted liberated souls, and their pastimes with Śrī Kṛṣṇa must be understood with the help of authorized ācāryas. When the gopīs came for the rāsa dance, Śrī Kṛṣṇa tried to preach karma-yoga to them, emphasizing ordinary ethics and morality, but the gopīs were beyond that. Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa now offers them jñāna-yoga, or metaphysical philosophy, but this is also inadequate for the gopīs, who have achieved spontaneous, unalloyed love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

ātmani — within Myself; eva — indeed; ātmanā — by Myself; ātmānam — Myself; sṛje — I create; hanmi — I destroy; anupālaye — I sustain; ātma — My own; māyā — of the mystic potency; anubhāvena — by the power; bhūta — the material elements; indriya — the senses; guṇa — and the modes of nature; ātmanā — comprising.
Translation
By Myself I create, sustain and withdraw Myself within Myself by the power of My personal energy, which comprises the material elements, the senses and the modes of nature.
Purport
Although the Lord is the supreme entity, there is no absolute duality between Him and His creation, since the creation is an extension of His being. This oneness is here emphasized by the Lord.

ātmā jñāna-mayaḥ śuddho
vyatirikto ’guṇānvayaḥ
suṣupti-svapna-jāgradbhir
māyā-vṛttibhir īyate
Synonyms
ātmā — the soul; jñāna-mayaḥ — comprising transcendental knowledge; śuddhaḥ — pure; vyatiriktaḥ — separate; aguṇa-anvayaḥ — uninvolved in the reactions of the material modes; suṣupti — in deep sleep; svapna — ordinary sleep; jāgradbhiḥ — and waking consciousness; māyā — of the material energy; vṛttibhiḥ — by the functions; īyate — is perceived.
Translation
Being composed of pure consciousness, or knowledge, the soul is distinct from everything material and is uninvolved in the entanglements of the modes of nature. We can perceive the soul through the three functions of material nature known as wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep.
Purport
It is clearly stated here that the soul, ātmā, is constituted of pure knowledge, pure consciousness, and is thus ontologically distinct from the material nature. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word ātmā may also be taken to mean “the Supreme Soul, Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Since the Lord has just explained in the previous verses that all material phenomena are expansions of Himself, the phrase māyā-vṛttibhir īyate indicates that by studying this world deeply we will come to the perception of God. From this point of view also, the gopīs were advised not to lament.

yenendriyārthān dhyāyeta
mṛṣā svapna-vad utthitaḥ
tan nirundhyād indriyāṇi
vinidraḥ pratyapadyata
Synonyms
yena — by which (mind); indriya — of the senses; arthān — upon the objects; dhyāyeta — one meditates; mṛṣā — false; svapna-vat — like a dream; utthitaḥ — arisen from sleep; tat — that (mind); nirundhyāt — one should bring under control; indriyāṇi — the senses; vinidraḥ — not sleeping (alert); pratyapadyata — they obtain.
Translation
As a person just arisen from sleep may continue to meditate on a dream even though it is illusory, so by the agency of the mind one meditates on the sense objects, which the senses can then obtain. Therefore one should become fully alert and bring the mind under control.
Purport
The verb pratipad means “to be perceived or restored.” The soul that is vinidra, free from the dreamlike condition of material consciousness, is restored to its constitutional position as an eternal servitor of the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus the soul is directly perceived by pure consciousness.

etad-antaḥ samāmnāyo
yogaḥ sāṅkhyaṁ manīṣiṇām
tyāgas tapo damaḥ satyaṁ
samudrāntā ivāpagāḥ
Synonyms
etat — having this; antaḥ — as its conclusion; samāmnāyaḥ — the entire Vedic literature; yogaḥ — the standard system of yoga; sāṅkhyam — the process of Sāṅkhya meditation, by which one learns to discriminate between spirit and matter; manīṣiṇām — of the intelligent; tyāgaḥ — renunciation; tapaḥ — austerity; damaḥ — sense control; satyam — and honesty; samudra-antāḥ — leading to the ocean; iva — as; āpa-gāḥ — rivers.
Translation
According to intelligent authorities, this is the ultimate conclusion of all the Vedas, as well as all practice of yoga, Sāṅkhya, renunciation, austerity, sense control and truthfulness, just as the sea is the ultimate destination of all rivers.
Purport
Here the Lord states that all Vedic literature is meant ultimately to bring the soul to the point of controlling the mind and senses and fixing them in transcendental self-realization. Thus processes of so-called yoga, mysticism or religion that involve unrestricted sense gratification are not actually spiritual processes but rather convenient ways for foolish people to justify their beastly behavior.
Lord Kṛṣṇa here assures the gopīs that by fixing their minds in self-realization, they will realize their spiritual oneness with the Lord. Thus they will no longer suffer the pangs of separation.

Synonyms
yat — the fact that; tu — however; aham — I; bhavatīnām — from your; vai — indeed; dūre — far away; varte — am situated; priyaḥ — who am dear; dṛśām — to the eyes; manasaḥ — of the mind; sannikarṣa — of the attraction; artham — for the sake; mat — upon Me; anudhyāna. — for your meditation; kāmyayā — out of My desire.
Translation
But the actual reason why I, the beloved object of your sight, have stayed far away from you is that I wanted to intensify your meditation upon Me and thus draw your minds closer to Me.
Purport
Sometimes that which is close to our eyes is far from our heart and mind, and conversely absence makes the heart grow fonder. Although apparently going far away from the gopīs, Lord Kṛṣṇa was bringing them closer to Him on the spiritual platform.

Translation
When her lover is far away, a woman thinks of him more than when he is present before her.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the same holds true for men, who become more absorbed in thinking of a beloved woman when she is far away than when she is present before their eyes.

Translation
Because your minds are totally absorbed in Me and free from all other engagement, you remember Me always, and so you will very soon have Me again in your presence.

Translation
Gentle Uddhava, is the elder brother of Gada now bestowing on the city women the pleasure that actually belongs to us? We suppose those ladies worship Him with generous glances full of affectionate, shy smiles.
Purport
The name Gadāgraja indicates Kṛṣṇa, the elder brother (agraja) of Gada, the first son of Devarakṣitā. She was a sister of Devakī’s who was also married to Vasudeva. The gopīs, by addressing Kṛṣṇa in this way, indicate that He now thinks of Himself mostly as the son of Devakī, the implication being that His connection with Vṛndāvana has now slackened. Because of intense love, the gopīs could not stop thinking of Kṛṣṇa for a moment.

Translation
Śrī Kṛṣṇa is expert in all kinds of conjugal affairs and is the darling of the city women. How can He not become entangled, now that He’s constantly adored by their enchanting words and gestures?

According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, each of these verses is spoken by a different gopī.

Translation
O saintly one, does Govinda ever remember us during His conversations with the city women? Does He ever mention us village girls as He freely talks with them?
Purport
The gopīs were so completely in love with Kṛṣṇa, without selfish motive, that even in their great disappointment they never considered giving their love to another. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī interprets their feelings as follows.
The gopīs might say, “Surely Kṛṣṇa has abandoned us because we deserve to be abandoned. Indeed, we are the most insignificant women in the world and have been rejected after having been enjoyed. Still, do we sometimes enter into His memory on account of some good quality of ours, or even because of something we did wrong? Kṛṣṇa must speak very freely with the city women. He and they must sing, joke, make riddles and talk about so many things. Does Kṛṣṇa ever say, ‘My dear city women, your sophisticated singing and speech is unknown to the gopīs in My home village. They couldn’t understand these things.’ Does He ever speak about us even in that way?”

Translation
Does He recall those nights in the Vṛndāvana forest, lovely with lotus, jasmine and the bright moon? As we glorified His charming pastimes, He enjoyed with us, His beloved girlfriends, in the circle of the rāsa dance, which resounded with the music of ankle bells.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following deep realization about this verse: “The gopīs knew that no place could be as beautiful as Vṛndāvana. Nowhere else in the universe could one find such a charming scene as the Vṛndāvana forest, which was scented with pious flowers and illumined by the full moon’s light reflected from the serene waves of the sacred Yamunā River. No one loved Kṛṣṇa as much as the gopīs, and thus no one else could understand Him as well. The gopīs rendered intimate service to Kṛṣṇa that only they could perfect. Thus the gopīs were distraught to think that Lord Kṛṣṇa was bereft of Vṛndāvana and bereft of their service. Free of all material lust, they were overwhelmed with disappointment because they could not give Kṛṣṇa happiness by their loving service. They simply could not imagine Kṛṣṇa enjoying anywhere else as He did in Vṛndāvana in their company.”

Purport
Although the gopīs lamented that Kṛṣṇa was associating with the city women in Mathurā, they now realize that as the absolute Personality of Godhead, He has no need for any women. It is out of His causeless mercy that He awards His association to His loving devotees.

The story of Piṅgalā is narrated in the Eleventh Canto, Eighth Chapter, of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

Translation
O master, O master of the goddess of fortune, O master of Vraja! O destroyer of all suffering, Govinda, please lift Your Gokula out of the ocean of distress in which it is drowning!
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī presents the following insight into this scene: Someone might propose to the gopīs, “Why don’t you just go somewhere else? Leave Vṛndāvana, and then you won’t have to see these rivers, mountains and forests. Cover your eyes with your garments, use your intelligence to lead your minds to some other thought, and thus forget Kṛṣṇa.” The gopīs answer this suggestion in the previous verse by stating, “We no longer possess our intelligence, for Kṛṣṇa has taken it away by His supreme beauty and charm.”
Now in the present verse the feelings of the gopīs become so strong that they disregard Uddhava and, turning toward Mathurā, address Kṛṣṇa Himself with humble cries. They address Kṛṣṇa as Vrajanātha because in the past young Kṛṣṇa performed many inconceivable pastimes to protect His beloved village people, such as lifting Govardhana Hill and destroying many monstrous demons. In this heartrending verse, the gopīs cry out to Kṛṣṇa to remember the wonderful, sweet relationship they once enjoyed together as innocent village people. Indeed, Śrī Kṛṣṇa would lovingly take care of His father’s cows, and the gopīs appealed to Him to remember these duties and return so He could resume them.

Purport
Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī states that the words jñatvātmānam adhokṣajam also indicate that the gopīs recognize Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the very soul of their lives and thus spiritually one with them.

The great ācārya Jīva Gosvāmī comments in this regard that Uddhava, during his stay in Vṛndāvana, certainly took special care to enliven Kṛṣṇa’s foster parents, Nanda and Yaśodā.

That servant of Lord Hari, seeing the rivers, forests, mountains, valleys and flowering trees of Vraja, enjoyed inspiring the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana by reminding them of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
Purport
Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that as Uddhava wandered about Vṛndāvana, he reminded Vraja’s residents of Kṛṣṇa by asking them questions about the pastimes the Lord had performed in each of these places, namely the rivers, forests, mountains and valleys. Thus Uddhava himself enjoyed great transcendental bliss in their association.

dṛṣṭvā — seeing; evam — such; ādi — and more; gopīnām — of the gopīs; kṛṣṇa-āveśa — their total absorption in thought of Kṛṣṇa; ātma — consisting of; viklavam — the mental agitation; uddhavaḥ — Uddhava; parama — supremely; prītaḥ — pleased; tāḥ — to them; namasyan — offering all respect; idam — this; jagau — sang.
Translation
Thus seeing how the gopīs were always disturbed because of their total absorption in Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava was supremely pleased. Desiring to offer them all respect, he sang as follows.
Purport
Viklava, “mental disturbance,” should not be confused here with ordinary material distress. It is clearly stated that Uddhava was supremely pleased, and he felt this way because he saw that the gopīs had attained the highest state of loving ecstasy. Uddhava was an exalted member of the court in Dvārakā, an important minister in world political affairs, and yet he felt the spiritual urge to offer his obeisances to the glorious gopīs, although externally they were mere cowherd girls in an insignificant village called Vṛndāvana. Thus, to explain his feelings he sang the following verses. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states that Uddhava sang these verses daily while he was in Vṛndāvana.

etāḥ — these women; param — alone; tanu — their bodies; bhṛtaḥ — maintain successfully; bhuvi — on the earth; gopa-vadhvaḥ — the young cowherd women; govinde — for Lord Kṛṣṇa; eva — exclusively; nikhila — of all; ātmani — the Soul; rūḍha — perfected; bhāvāḥ — ecstatic loving attraction; vāñchanti — they desire; yat — which; bhava — material existence; bhiyaḥ — those who are afraid of; munayaḥ — sages; vayam — we; ca — also; kim — what use; brahma — as a brāhmaṇa or as Lord Brahmā; janmabhiḥ — with births; ananta — of the unlimited Lord; kathā — for the topics; rasasya — for one who has a taste.
Translation
[Uddhava sang:] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that here the term brahma-janmabhiḥ, “brahminical births,” refers to the threefold birth by (1) seminal parenthood, (2) sacred-thread initiation and (3) sacrificial initiation. These cannot compare to pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Synonyms
kva — where, in comparison; imāḥ — these; striyaḥ — women; vana — in the forests; carīḥ — who wander; vyabhicāra — by improper behavior; duṣṭāḥ — contaminated; kṛṣṇe — for Kṛṣṇa; kva ca — and where; eṣaḥ — this; parama-ātmani — for the Supreme Soul; rūḍha-bhāvaḥ — stage of perfect love (known technically as mahā-bhāva); nanu — certainly; īśvaraḥ — the Personality of Godhead; anubhajataḥ — to one who constantly worships Him; aviduṣaḥ — not learned; api — even though; sākṣāt — directly; śreyaḥ — the highest good; tanoti — bestows; agada — of medicines; rājaḥ — the king (namely, the nectar which the demigods drink for long life); iva — as if; upayuktaḥ — taken.
Translation
How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.
Purport
The use of the word kva in the first two lines indicates a sharp contrast between apparently incompatible items, in this case the apparently insignificant and even impure position of the gopīs, mentioned in the first line, and their attainment of the highest perfection of life, mentioned in the second. In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes three types of adulterous women. The first is a woman who enjoys both her husband and a lover, being faithful to neither. Both ordinary society and the scriptures condemn this conduct. The second type of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband to enjoy only with her lover. Society and the scriptures also condemn this behavior, although such a fallen woman may be said to at least have the good quality of dedicating herself to a single man. The last kind of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband and enjoys in the attitude of being a lover of the Supreme Lord alone. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that although foolish, common people criticize this position, such behavior is commended by those who are wise in spiritual science. Therefore learned members of society and the revealed scriptures praise such single-minded devotion to the Lord. Such was the gopīs’ behavior. Thus the term vyabhicāra-duṣṭāḥ, “corrupted by deviation,” indicates the apparent resemblance between the gopīs’ behavior and that of ordinary adulterous women.

Translation
When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?
Purport
The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 8.80).
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows: Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of all avatāras, exists on the highest platform of purity and morality, and thus He always remained praiseworthy by all, even while accepting worldly criticism for His cow-tending, wandering in the forest, taking meals with young monkeys, stealing yogurt, seducing other men’s wives, and so on. Similarly, the gopīs, who are constituted of the Lord’s pleasure potency, achieved the highest standard of purity and auspiciousness, even in comparison to the goddesses of fortune, and thus the gopīs are supremely glorious, even though they were criticized by worldly people because they were mere cowherd women living in the forest and behaving in an apparently improper way.

Translation
The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to be one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.
Purport
The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Antya 7.47).
Śrī Uddhava here shows the perfect Vaiṣṇava attitude of humility. He does not pray to be equal to the gopīs in their exalted stage of love, but rather to take birth as a bush or creeper in Vṛndāvana so that when they walk upon him he will get the dust of their feet and thus be blessed. The shy gopīs would never agree to give such blessings to a great personality like Uddhava; therefore he cleverly sought to get such mercy by taking birth as a plant in Vṛndāvana.

Translation
The goddess of fortune herself, along with Lord Brahmā and all the other demigods, who are masters of yogic perfection, can worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa only within her mind. But during the rāsa dance Lord Kṛṣṇa placed His feet upon these gopīs’ breasts, and by embracing those feet the gopīs gave up all distress.

I repeatedly offer my respects to the dust from the feet of the women of Nanda Mahārāja’s cowherd village. When these gopīs loudly chant the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the vibration purifies the three worlds.
Purport
Śrī Uddhava, having established the glories of the gopīs in the previous verses, now directly offers his obeisances to them. According to the Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī, Śrī Uddhava did not offer such respect even to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens in Dvārakā.

[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:] O ruler of men, thus honored by the cowherd men with expressions of devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava went back to the city of Mathurā, which was under Kṛṣṇa’s protection.

The word kṛṣṇa-pālitām indicates that even though Uddhava became quite attached to the land of Vṛndāvana, he returned to Mathurā because Śrī Kṛṣṇa was personally displaying His transcendental pastimes there.
