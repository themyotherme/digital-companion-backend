CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR

The Marriage of Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī
This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa defeated the opposing kings after kidnapping Rukmiṇī, disfigured Rukmiṇī’s brother Rukmī, brought Rukmiṇī to His capital and married her.
As Śrī Kṛṣṇa was taking Princess Rukmiṇī away, the inimical kings gathered their armies and pursued Him. Lord Baladeva and the generals of the Yādava army turned to face these opponents, blocking their advance. The enemy armies then began pouring incessant showers of arrows upon Lord Kṛṣṇa’s army. Seeing her husband-to-be’s forces under such violent attack, Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī looked at Śrī Kṛṣṇa fearfully. But Kṛṣṇa simply smiled and told her there was nothing to fear because His army would surely destroy the enemy in short order.
Lord Balarāma and the other heroes then began to annihilate the opposing army with nārāca arrows. The enemy kings, headed by Jarāsandha, retreated after suffering the destruction of their armies at the hands of the Yādavas.
Jarāsandha consoled Śiśupāla: “Happiness and distress are never permanent and are under the control of the Supreme Lord. Seventeen times Kṛṣṇa defeated me, but in the end I was victorious over Him. Thus seeing that victory and defeat are under the control of destiny and time, I have learned not to succumb to either lamentation or joy. Time now favors the Yādavas, so they have defeated you with only a small army, but in the future time will favor you, and you will surely conquer them.” Consoled in this way, Śiśupāla took his followers and returned to his kingdom.
Rukmiṇī’s brother Rukmī, who hated Kṛṣṇa, was infuriated by Kṛṣṇa’s kidnapping of his sister. So, after vowing before all the kings present that he would not return to Kuṇḍina until Kṛṣṇa had been destroyed and Rukmiṇī rescued, Rukmī set out with his army to attack the Lord. Ignorant of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glories, Rukmī boldly went out to attack Kṛṣṇa in a lone chariot. He approached the Lord, struck Him with arrows and demanded that He release Rukmiṇī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa fended off Rukmī’s weapons, breaking them to pieces. Then He raised His sword high and was about to kill Rukmī when Rukmiṇī interceded and fervently pleaded that her brother’s life be spared. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not kill Rukmī, but with His sword He shaved off bits of Rukmī’s hair here and there, leaving him disfigured. Just then Lord Baladeva appeared on the scene with the Yādava army. Seeing Rukmī disfigured, He gently reproached Kṛṣṇa: “To disfigure such a close family member is as good as killing him; therefore he should not be killed but set free.”
Lord Baladeva then told Rukmiṇī that the sorry condition of her brother was only the fruit of his past work, since everyone is responsible for his own happiness and suffering. He further instructed her about the transcendental position of the jīva soul and how the illusion of happiness and distress is simply a result of ignorance. Accepting Lord Balarāma’s instructions, Rukmiṇī gave up her sorrow.
Rukmī, meanwhile, felt totally frustrated, deprived as he was of all his strength and his will to fight. Since he had vowed not to return home without conquering Kṛṣṇa, Rukmī constructed a city on that very spot and took up residence there in a mood of undiminished anger.
Lord Kṛṣṇa took Rukmiṇī to His capital, Dvārakā, and married her. All the citizens celebrated in lavish style, broadcasting throughout the city accounts of how the Lord had kidnapped Rukmiṇī. Everyone in Dvārakā was delighted to see Lord Kṛṣṇa united with Rukmiṇī.

Purport
To express His great affection for Rukmiṇī, Lord Kṛṣṇa gallantly referred to His own Yādava army as “your men,” indicating that the Lord’s entire dynasty was now the property of His beloved queen. The Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, desires to share His blissful opulences with all living beings, and thus He sincerely invites them to come back home, back to Godhead. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, introduced throughout the world by Śrīla Prabhupāda on the order of his spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who himself preached all over India on the order of his exalted father, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, is broadcasting the loving message of Lord Kṛṣṇa: Remember Him, serve Him, return to Him and share in the infinite bounty of the kingdom of God.

Just as a puppet in the form of a woman dances by the desire of the puppeteer, so this world, controlled by the Supreme Lord, struggles in both happiness and misery.
Purport
By the will of the Supreme Lord, living beings are awarded the proper results of their own activities. One who understands the Absolute Truth surrenders to the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and is no longer considered to be within the material system of existence. Since those endeavoring within the material system, or world, are necessarily trying to exploit the creation of God, they must be subjected to reactions, which are perceived by the conditioned souls as miserable and joyful. In fact, the entire material way of life is a fiasco when seen from the perspective of absolute bliss.

Purport
Having stated that the Supreme Lord controls this world, Jarāsandha explains the specific method of control. It should be remembered that in the Vedic context kāla, or time, does not refer merely to a system of measuring planetary movements such as days, weeks, months and years but rather to the way things are being moved. Everything is moving according to its destiny, and this destiny is also described as “time,” since everyone’s destiny is revealed and imposed by the movements of time.

Purport
Rukmī spoke these angry words and then set off to pursue Lord Kṛṣṇa, as described in the following verses.

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that gopālasya actually means “of the protector of the Vedas,” while durmateḥ means “of Him whose beautiful mind is compassionate even toward the wicked.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that the real meaning of what Rukmī said is that today, fighting with Lord Kṛṣṇa, Rukmī would relieve himself of his pretensions to being a great hero.

Boasting thus, foolish Rukmī, ignorant of the true extent of the Supreme Lord’s power, approached Lord Govinda in his lone chariot and challenged Him, “Just stand and fight!”
Purport
It appears from these verses that though Rukmī set out with an entire military division, he personally rushed up to Lord Kṛṣṇa to fight with Him.

Purport

“Wherever You go, carrying off my sister like a crow stealing sacrificial butter, I will follow. This very day I shall relieve You of Your false pride, You fool, You deceiver, You cheater in battle!
Purport
In his hysterical attack, Rukmī displays the very qualities he attributes to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Every living being is part and parcel of the Lord and belongs to the Lord. Therefore Rukmī was like a crow trying to steal the sacrificial offering meant for the enjoyment of the Lord.

“Release the girl before You are struck dead by my arrows and made to lie down!” In response to this, Lord Kṛṣṇa smiled, and with six arrows He struck Rukmī and broke his bow.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that in fact Lord Kṛṣṇa was meant to lie down together with Rukmiṇī on a beautiful bed of flowers, but out of shyness Rukmī did not directly mention this point.

Translation
As Rukmī attacked Him, the Lord shot arrows that broke Rukmī’s sword and shield into small pieces. Kṛṣṇa then took up His own sharp sword and prepared to kill Rukmī.

Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes the “worldly rule” that one’s sister is the personification of mercy: dayāyā bhaginī mūrtiḥ. Even though Rukmī was wicked and was opposed to his sister’s best interest, Rukmiṇī was compassionate toward him, and the Lord shared her compassion.

Translation
Lord Kṛṣṇa tied up the evil-doer with a strip of cloth. He then proceeded to disfigure Rukmī by comically shaving him, leaving parts of his mustache and hair. By that time the Yadu heroes had crushed the extraordinary army of their opponents, just as elephants crush a lotus flower.
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa used His same sharp sword to give the wicked Rukmī a peculiar haircut.

Translation
[Lord Balarāma said:] My dear Kṛṣṇa, You have acted improperly! This deed will bring shame on Us, for to disfigure a close relative by shaving off his mustache and hair is as good as killing him.
Purport
Omniscient Balarāma knew that Rukmī was the guilty party, but to encourage the lamenting Rukmiṇī He decided to gently reproach Śrī Kṛṣṇa

Saintly lady, please do not be displeased with Us out of anxiety for your brother’s disfigurement. No one but oneself is responsible for one’s joy and grief, for a man experiences the result of his own deeds.

Purport
To further encourage Lady Rukmiṇī, Balarāma again emphasizes that Kṛṣṇa should not humiliate Rukmī.

kṣatriyāṇām — of warriors; ayam — this; dharmaḥ — code of sacred duty; prajāpati — by the original progenitor, Lord Brahmā; vinirmitaḥ — established; bhrātā — a brother; api — even; bhrātaram — his brother; hanyāt — has to kill; yena — by which (code); ghora-tamaḥ — most terrible; tataḥ — therefore.
Translation
[Turning to Rukmiṇī, Balarāma continued:] The code of sacred duty for warriors established by Lord Brahmā enjoins that one may have to kill even his own brother. That is indeed a most dreadful law.
Purport
Lord Balarāma, in the interest of fairness, is giving a complete analysis of the situation. Although one should not kill a relative, there are extenuating circumstances according to military codes. In the American Civil War, which took place in the 1860s, many families were divided between the army of the North and that of the South, and thus fratricidal killing unfortunately became a common affair. Such killing is certainly ghoratama, most dreadful. Yet such is the nature of the material world, where duty, honor and so-called justice often create conflict. Only on the spiritual platform, in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, can we transcend the unacceptable pain of material existence. Rukmī was maddened by pride and envy and thus could not understand anything about Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Translation
[Again Balarāma addressed Kṛṣṇa:] Blinded by conceit with their personal opulences, proud men offend others for the sake of such things as kingdom, land, wealth, women, honor and power.
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa was originally meant to marry Rukmiṇī. All along this was the best arrangement for all concerned, and yet from the beginning Rukmī had maliciously opposed this beautiful arrangement. When his sister’s desire was finally fulfilled and she was taken by Kṛṣṇa, he viciously attacked the Lord with vulgar insults and mortal weapons. In return Lord Kṛṣṇa tied him up and partially clipped his hair and mustache. While certainly humiliating for a puffed-up prince like Rukmī, his punishment was a mere slap on the wrist, considering what he had done.

Translation
The Supreme Lord’s Māyā makes men forget their real selves, and thus, taking the body for the self, they consider others to be friends, enemies or neutral parties.

Translation
Those who are bewildered perceive the one Supreme Soul, who resides in all embodied beings, as many, just as one may perceive the light in the sky, or the sky itself, as many.
Purport
The last line of this text, yathā jyotir yathā nabhaḥ, introduces two analogies in which we perceive one thing to be many. Jyotiḥ indicates the light of heavenly bodies such as the sun or moon. Although there is only one moon, we may see the moon reflected in pools, rivers, lakes and buckets of water. Then it would appear as if there were many moons, although there is only one. Similarly, we perceive a divine presence in each living being because the Supreme Lord is present everywhere, although He is one. The second analogy given here, yathā nabhaḥ, is that of the sky. If we have a row of sealed clay pots in a room, the sky, or air, is in each pot, although the sky itself is one.
The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.2.32) gives a similar analogy concerning fire and wood:
yathā hy avahito vahnir
dāruṣv ekaḥ sva-yoniṣu
nāneva bhāti viśvātmā
bhūteṣu ca tathā pumān
“The Lord, as the Supersoul, pervades all things, just as fire permeates wood, and so He appears to be of many varieties, though He is the absolute one without a second.”

Synonyms
dehaḥ — the material body; ādi — beginning; anta — and end; vān — having; eṣaḥ — this; dravya — of the physical elements; prāṇa — the senses; guṇa — and the primary modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance); ātmakaḥ — composed; ātmani — on the self; avidyayā — by material ignorance; kḷptaḥ — imposed; saṁsārayati — causes to experience the cycle of birth and death; dehinam — an embodied being.
Translation
This material body, which has a beginning and an end, is composed of the physical elements, the senses and the modes of nature. The body, imposed on the self by material ignorance, causes one to experience the cycle of birth and death.
Purport
The material body, composed of various material qualities, elements and so on, attracts and repels the conditioned soul and thus entangles him in material existence. Because of our attraction and repulsion for our own body and other bodies, we establish temporary relationships, dedicate ourselves to great endeavors and sacrifices, concoct imaginary religions, make noble speeches and thoroughly involve ourselves in material illusion. As Shakespeare said, “All the world’s a stage.” Beyond the somewhat absurd theater of material existence is the real and meaningful world of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the liberated life of pure souls devoted in loving service to the Supreme Lord.

na — not; ātmanaḥ — for the self; anyena — with anything else; saṁyogaḥ — contact; viyogaḥ — separation; ca — and; asataḥ — with that which is insubstantial; sati — O discriminating one; tat — from it (the self); hetutvāt — because of originating; tat — by it (the self); prasiddheḥ — because of being revealed; dṛk — with the sense of vision; rūpābhyām — and visible form; yathā — as; raveḥ — for the sun.
Translation
O intelligent lady, the soul never undergoes contact with or separation from insubstantial, material objects, because the soul is their very origin and illuminator. Thus the soul resembles the sun, which neither comes in contact with nor separates from the sense of sight and what is seen.
Purport
As explained in the previous text, the conditioned soul ignorantly assumes himself to be the material body and thus rotates in the cycle of birth and death. In fact, matter and spirit are co-energies of the original source of everything, the Supreme Lord, who is the Absolute Truth.
As Lord Kṛṣṇa explains in the Bhagavad-gītā (7.5), jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat. The material world is sustained by the living beings’ desire to exploit it. The material world is like a prison. Criminals are determined to commit crimes, and thus the government finds it necessary to maintain a prison system. Similarly, the Supreme Lord maintains the material universes because the conditioned souls are determined to rebel against Him and try to enjoy without His loving cooperation. Thus here the phrase tad-dhetutvāt is used to describe the soul, meaning that the soul is the cause of matter assembling itself into a material body. The term tat-prasiddheḥ indicates that the soul is the cause of the body’s being perceived, and the same term also indicates that this fact is well known to the enlightened.
Besides its given meaning, the word ātmanaḥ in this verse may indicate the Supreme Soul, in which case the term tad-dhetutvāt indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa expands His personal potency and thus manifests the material universe. Since the Lord exists eternally in His pure, spiritual body, He never becomes material, as indicated here.

Synonyms
janma-ādayaḥ — birth and so on; tu — but; dehasya — of the body; vikriyāḥ — transformations; na — not; ātmanaḥ — of the self; kvacit — ever; kalānām — of the phases; iva — as; na — not; eva — indeed; indoḥ — of the moon; mṛtiḥ — the death; hi — indeed; asya — of it; kuhūḥ — the new moon day; iva — as.
Translation
Birth and other transformations are undergone by the body but never by the self, just as change occurs for the moon’s phases but never for the moon, though the new-moon day may be called the moon’s “death.”
Purport
Lord Balarāma here explains how the conditioned souls identify with the body and how this identification should be given up. Certainly every ordinary person considers himself or herself young, middle-aged or old, healthy or sick. But such identification is an illusion, just as the waxing and waning of the moon is an illusion. When we identify ourselves with the material body, we lose our power to understand the soul.

Purport
As stated in śruti, asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣaḥ: “The living being has no intimate connection with the material world.” This point is explained in the present verse. A similar statement is found in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.22.56):
arthe ’hy avidyamāne ’pi
saṁsṛtir na nivartate
dhyāyato viṣayān asya
svapne ’narthāgamo yathā
“For one who is meditating on sense gratification, material life, although lacking factual existence, does not go away, just as the unpleasant experiences of a dream do not.”
