CHAPTER FORTY-SIX

Uddhava Visits Vṛndāvana
This chapter describes how Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent Uddhava to Vraja to relieve the distress of Nanda, Yaśodā and the young gopīs.
One day Lord Kṛṣṇa asked His intimate friend Uddhava to take news of Him to Vraja and thus relieve His parents and the gopīs of their misery caused by their separation from Him. Riding on a chariot, Uddhava reached Vraja at sunset. He saw the cows returning home to the cowherd village and the calves jumping here and there as their mothers followed slowly behind, weighed down by their heavy milk bags. The cowherd men and women were chanting the glories of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, and the village was attractively decorated with burning incense and rows of lamps. All this presented a scene of exceptional transcendental beauty.
Nanda Mahārāja welcomed Uddhava warmly into his home. The cowherd King then worshiped him as nondifferent from Lord Vāsudeva, fed him nicely, seated him comfortably upon a bed and then inquired from him about the welfare of Vasudeva and his sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Nanda asked, “Does Kṛṣṇa still remember His friends, the village of Gokula and Govardhana Hill? He protected us from a forest fire, wind and rain, and many other disasters. By remembering His pastimes again and again, we are relieved of all karmic entanglement, and when we see the places marked by His lotus feet, our minds become fully absorbed in thought of Him. Garga Muni told me that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma have both descended directly from the spiritual world. Just see how They have so easily dispatched Kaṁsa, the wrestlers, the elephant Kuvalayāpīḍa and many other demons!” As Nanda remembered Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, his throat choked up with tears and he could speak no further. Meanwhile, as mother Yaśodā heard her husband speak of Kṛṣṇa, the intense love she felt for her son caused a flood of milk to pour from her breasts and a torrent of tears from her eyes.
Seeing the superexcellent affection Nanda and Yaśodā had for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava commented, “You two are indeed most glorious. One who has attained pure love for the Supreme Absolute Truth in His humanlike form has nothing further to accomplish. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma are present in the hearts of all living beings, just as fire lies dormant within wood. These two Lords see all equally, having no particular friends or enemies. Free from egoism and possessiveness, They have no father, mother, wife or children, are never subject to birth, and have no material body. Only to enjoy spiritual happiness and deliver Their saintly devotees do They appear by Their own sweet will among various species of life, both high and low.
“Lord Kṛṣṇa is not merely the son of you, O Nanda and Yaśodā, but the son of all persons, as well as their mother and father. In fact, He is everyone’s dearest relation inasmuch as nothing that is seen or heard in the past, present or future, among the moving or nonmoving, is independent of Him.”
Nanda Mahārāja and Uddhava passed the night talking about Kṛṣṇa in this way. Then the cowherd women performed their morning worship and began churning butter, singing the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa as they busily pulled the churning ropes. The sounds of churning and singing reverberated into the sky, cleansing the world of all inauspiciousness.
When the sun rose, the gopīs saw Uddhava’s chariot at the edge of the cowherd village, and they thought that Akrūra might have returned. But just then Uddhava finished his morning duties and presented himself before them.

śrī-śuka uvāca
vṛṣṇīnāṁ pravaro mantrī
kṛṣṇasya dayitaḥ sakhā
śiṣyo bṛhaspateḥ sākṣād

Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: The supremely intelligent Uddhava was the best counselor of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty, a beloved friend of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and a direct disciple of Bṛhaspati.
Purport
The ācāryas give various reasons why Lord Kṛṣṇa sent Uddhava to Vṛndāvana. The Lord had promised the residents of Vṛndāvana: āyāsye, “I shall return.” (Bhāg. 10.39.35) Also, in the previous chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa promised Nanda Mahārāja: draṣṭum eṣyāmaḥ, “We will come back to see you and mother Yaśodā.” (Bhāg. 10.45.23) At the same time, the Lord could not break His promise to Śrī Vasudeva and mother Devakī to finally spend some time with them after they had suffered for so many years. Therefore, the Lord decided to send His intimate representative to Vṛndāvana in His place.
The question may be asked, Why did Kṛṣṇa not invite Nanda and Yaśodā to visit Him in Mathurā? According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, for the Lord to have exchanged loving feelings with Nanda and Yaśodā in the same place and at the same time that He was exchanging them with Vasudeva and Devakī would have created an awkward situation in the Lord’s pastimes. Thus Kṛṣṇa did not invite Nanda and Yaśodā to stay with Him in Mathurā. The residents of Vṛndāvana had their own way of understanding Kṛṣṇa, and their feelings could not have been appropriately expressed on a regular basis in the kingly atmosphere of Mathurā.
Śrī Uddhava is described in this verse as buddhi-sattamaḥ, “the most intelligent,” and thus he could expertly pacify the residents of Vṛndāvana, who were feeling such intense separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa. Then, upon his return to Mathurā, Uddhava would describe to all the members of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty the extraordinary pure love he had seen in Vṛndāvana. Indeed, the love the cowherd men and gopīs felt for Kṛṣṇa was far beyond anything the Lord’s other devotees had ever experienced, and by hearing about that love all the Lord’s devotees would increase their faith and devotion.
As stated in the Third Canto by the Lord Himself, noddhavo ’nv api man-nyūnaḥ: “Uddhava is not even slightly different from Me.” Resembling Kṛṣṇa so much, Uddhava was the perfect person to carry out the Lord’s mission in Vṛndāvana. In fact, Śrī Hari-vaṁśa states that Uddhava is the son of Vasudeva’s brother Devabhāga: uddhavo devabhāgasya mahā-bhāgaḥ suto ’bhavat. In other words, he is a cousin-brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s.

ता मन्मनस्का मत्प्राणा मतर्थे त्यक्तदैहिका: ।

tā man-manaskā mat-prāṇā
mat-arthe tyakta-daihikāḥ
mām eva dayitaṁ preṣṭham
ātmānaṁ manasā gatāḥ
ye tyakta-loka-dharmāś ca

Synonyms
tāḥ — they (the gopīs); mat — absorbed in Me; manaskāḥ — their minds; mat — fixed upon Me; prāṇāḥ — their lives; mat-arthe — for My sake; tyakta — abandoning; daihikāḥ — everything on the bodily platform; mām — Me; eva — alone; dayitam — their beloved; preṣṭham — dearmost; ātmānam — Self; manasā gatāḥ — understood; ye — who (the gopīs, or anyone); tyakta — giving up; loka — this world; dharmāḥ — religiosity; ca — and; mat-arthe — for My sake; tān — them; bibharmi — sustain; aham — I.
Translation
The minds of those gopīs are always absorbed in Me, and their very lives are ever devoted to Me. For My sake they have abandoned everything related to their bodies, renouncing ordinary happiness in this life, as well as religious duties necessary for such happiness in the next life. I alone am their dearmost beloved and, indeed, their very Self. I personally sustain such devotees, who for My sake give up all worldly duties.
Purport
Here the Lord explains why He wants to send a special message to the gopīs. According to the Vaiṣṇava ācāryas, the word daihikāḥ, “related to the body,” refers to husbands, children, homes and so on. The gopīs loved Kṛṣṇa so intensely that they could think of nothing else. Since Śrī Kṛṣṇa maintains ordinary devotees engaged in sādhana-bhakti, devotional service in practice, He will certainly maintain the gopīs, His most exalted devotees.

मयि ता: प्रेयसां प्रेष्ठे दूरस्थे गोकुलस्‍त्रिय: ।
स्मरन्त्योऽङ्ग विमुह्यन्ति विरहौत्कण्ठ्यविह्वला: ॥ ५ ॥
mayi tāḥ preyasāṁ preṣṭhe
dūra-sthe gokula-striyaḥ
smarantyo ’ṅga vimuhyanti
virahautkaṇṭhya-vihvalāḥ
Synonyms
mayi — I; tāḥ — they; preyasām — of all objects of endearment; preṣṭhe — the most dear; dūra-sthe — being far away; gokula-striyaḥ — the women of Gokula; smarantyaḥ — remembering; aṅga — dear (Uddhava); vimuhyanti — become stunned; viraha — of separation; autkaṇṭhya — by the anxiety; vihvalāḥ — overwhelmed.
Translation
My dear Uddhava, for those women of Gokula I am the most cherished object of love. Thus when they remember Me, who am so far away, they are overwhelmed by the anxiety of separation.
Purport
Whatever is dear to us becomes an object of our possessiveness. Ultimately the most dear object is our very soul, or our self. Thus things in a favorable relationship to our self also become dear to us, and we try to possess them. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, among countless millions of such dear things, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the most dear of all, even dearer than one’s own self. The gopīs had realized this fact, and thus they were stunned in separation from the Lord because of their intense love for Him. Although they would have given up their lives, they were kept alive by the Lord’s transcendental potency.

Translation
Simply because I have promised to return to them, My fully devoted cowherd girlfriends struggle to maintain their lives somehow or other.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, although the gopīs of Vṛndāvana were apparently married, their husbands actually had no contact whatsoever with their supremely attractive qualities of form, taste, fragrance, sound, touch and so on. Rather, their husbands merely presumed, “These are our wives.” In other words, by Lord Kṛṣṇa’s spiritual potency, the gopīs existed entirely for His pleasure, and Kṛṣṇa loved them in the mood of a paramour. In fact, the gopīs were manifestations of Kṛṣṇa’s internal nature, His supreme pleasure potency, and on the spiritual platform they attracted the Lord by their pure love.
Nanda Mahārāja and mother Yaśodā, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s parents in Vṛndāvana, had also attained a most exalted state of love for Kṛṣṇa, and they too could barely maintain their lives in His absence. Thus Uddhava would also give special attention to them.

Gokula resounded on all sides with the sounds of bulls in rut fighting with one another for fertile cows; with the mooing of cows, burdened by their udders, chasing after their calves; with the noise of milking and of the white calves jumping here and there; with the loud reverberation of flute-playing; and with the singing of the all-auspicious deeds of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma by the cowherd men and women, who made the village resplendent with their wonderfully ornamented attire. The cowherds’ homes in Gokula appeared most charming with their abundant paraphernalia for worship of the sacrificial fire, the sun, unexpected guests, the cows, the brāhmaṇas, the forefathers and the demigods. On all sides lay the flowering forest, echoing with flocks of birds and swarms of bees and beautified by its lakes crowded with swans, kāraṇḍava ducks and bowers of lotuses.
Purport
Although Gokula was merged in grief because of separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Lord expanded His internal potency to cover that particular manifestation of Vraja and allow Uddhava to see the normal bustle and joy of Vraja at sunset.

Translation

Here Nanda means to say, “Not only did Garga Muni declare that these boys are divine, but just see what They have done! Everyone is talking about it.”

As mother Yaśodā heard the descriptions of her son’s activities, she poured out her tears, and milk flowed from her breasts out of love.
Purport
From the very day that Kṛṣṇa had left for Mathurā, mother Yaśodā, though counseled and consoled by hundreds of men and women, could see nothing but the face of her son. She kept her eyes closed to everyone else and cried constantly. Thus she could not recognize Uddhava, treat him with parental affection, ask him any questions or give him any message for her son. She was simply overwhelmed with love for Kṛṣṇa.

Translation
Uddhava then joyfully addressed Nanda Mahārāja, having clearly seen the supreme loving attraction he and Yaśodā felt for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Purport
If Uddhava had seen Nanda and Yaśodā actually suffering, he would not have reacted with joy. But in fact all emotions on the spiritual platform are transcendental bliss. The so-called anguish of the pure devotees is another form of loving ecstasy. This was clearly seen by Uddhava, and thus he spoke as follows.

Translation
Śrī Uddhava said: O respectful Nanda, certainly you and mother Yaśodā are the most praiseworthy persons in the entire world, since you have developed such a loving attitude toward Lord Nārāyaṇa, the spiritual master of all living beings.
Purport
Understanding Nanda’s mood, as expressed by his statement manye kṛṣṇaṁ ca rāmaṁ ca prāptāv iha surottamau (“I think Kṛṣṇa and Rāma must be two exalted demigods”), Uddhava here referred to Kṛṣṇa as Lord Nārāyaṇa.

एतौ हि विश्वस्य च बीजयोनी

etau hi viśvasya ca bīja-yonī
rāmo mukundaḥ puruṣaḥ pradhānam
anvīya bhūteṣu vilakṣaṇasya
jñānasya ceśāta imau purāṇau
Synonyms
etau — these two; hi — indeed; viśvasya — of the universe; ca — and; bīja — the seed; yonī — and the womb; rāmaḥ — Lord Balarāma; mukundaḥ — Lord Kṛṣṇa; puruṣaḥ — the creating Lord; pradhānam — His creative energy; anvīya — entering; bhūteṣu — within all living beings; vilakṣaṇasya — confused or perceiving; jñānasya — knowledge; ca — and; īśāte — control; imau — They; purāṇau — primeval.
Translation
These two Lords, Mukunda and Balarāma, are each the seed and womb of the universe, the creator and His creative potency. They enter the hearts of living beings and control their conditioned awareness. They are the primeval Supreme.
Purport
The word vilakṣaṇa means either “distinctly perceiving” or “confused,” depending on how the prefix vi is understood in context. In the case of enlightened souls, vilakṣaṇa means “perceiving the correct distinction between the body and the soul” and thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, as indicated by the word īśāte, guides the spiritually advancing soul. The other meaning of vilakṣaṇa — “confused” or “bewildered” — clearly applies to those who have not understood the difference between the soul and the body, or the distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. Such bewildered living beings do not go back home, back to Godhead, to the eternal spiritual world, but rather achieve temporary destinations according to the laws of nature.
It is understood from all Vaiṣṇava literature that Śrī Rāma, Balarāma, here accompanying Lord Kṛṣṇa, is nondifferent from Him, being His plenary expansion. The Lord is one, yet He expands Himself, and thus Lord Balarāma in no way compromises the principle of monotheism.

Translation
Anyone, even a person in an impure state, who absorbs his mind in Him for just a moment at the time of death burns up all traces of sinful reactions and immediately attains the supreme transcendental destination in a pure, spiritual form as effulgent as the sun. You two have rendered exceptional loving service to Him, Lord Nārāyaṇa, the Supersoul of all and the cause of all existence, the great soul who, although the original cause of everything, has a humanlike form. What pious deeds could still be required of you?

Translation
Although beyond the three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — the transcendental Lord accepts association with them as His play. Thus the unborn Supreme Lord utilizes the material modes to create, maintain and destroy.
Purport
As stated in the Brahma-sūtra (2.1.33), loka-vat līlā-kaivalyam: “The Lord performs His spiritual pastimes as if He were a resident of this world.”
Although the Lord does not favor or abuse anyone, we still observe happiness and suffering in this world. The Gītā (13.22) states, kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya: We desire to associate with various qualities of material nature, and thus we must accept the consequences. The Lord provides the field of material nature, in which we exercise our free will. Foolish nondevotees not only attempt to cheat the Lord by trying to exploit His nature, but when they suffer the reaction they blame God for their own misdeeds. This is the shameless position of those who are envious of God.

Translation
Just as a person who is whirling around perceives the ground to be turning, one who is affected by false ego thinks himself the doer, when actually only his mind is acting.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives a parallel idea: Although our happiness and distress are caused by our own interaction with the material qualities, we perceive the Lord to be their cause.

Purport
Śrī Uddhava is relieving the distress of Nanda and Yaśodā by bringing them to a more philosophical plane. He is explaining that since Lord Kṛṣṇa is everything and is within everything, His pure devotees are always with Him.
