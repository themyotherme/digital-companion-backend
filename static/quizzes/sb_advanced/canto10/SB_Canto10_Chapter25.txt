CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

Lord Kṛṣṇa Lifts Govardhana Hill
This chapter describes how Lord Indra was overcome by anger when the residents of Vraja canceled his sacrifice, how he tried to punish them by sending forth a devastating rainfall to Vṛndāvana, and how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa protected Gokula by lifting Govardhana Hill and for seven days using it as an umbrella to ward off the rain.
Indra, angered at the disruption of the sacrifice meant for him and falsely presuming himself the supreme controller, said, “People often give up the pursuit of transcendental knowledge — the means for self-realization — and imagine that they can cross over the ocean of material existence by mundane fruitive sacrifices. Similarly, these cowherd men have become intoxicated by pride and have offended me by taking shelter of an ignorant, ordinary child — Kṛṣṇa.”
To remove this supposed pride of the residents of Vraja, Indra sent the clouds known as Sāṁvartaka, whose function is to facilitate the destruction of the world. He sent them to harass the Vrajavāsīs with downpours of rain and hail. The cowherd community was very disturbed by this and approached Kṛṣṇa for shelter. Understanding that this trouble was the work of Indra, Kṛṣṇa decided to smash to pieces Indra’s false prestige, and thus He lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand. He then invited the entire cowherd community to take shelter in the dry space beneath the mountain. For seven successive days He held up the hill, until Indra finally understood Kṛṣṇa’s mystic power and ordered the clouds to withdraw.
When the cowherd villagers emerged from beneath the mountain, Kṛṣṇa put Govardhana Hill back in its proper place. The cowherds were in ecstasy, showing loving symptoms such as flowing tears and bodily hairs standing on end. They embraced Kṛṣṇa and offered Him benedictions according to their respective positions, while the demigods in heaven rained down flowers and sang the Lord’s praises.

श्रीशुक उवाच
इन्द्रस्तदात्मन: पूजां विज्ञाय विहतां नृप । गोपेभ्य: कृष्णनाथेभ्यो नन्दादिभ्यश्चुकोप ह ॥ १ ॥
śrī-śuka uvāca
indras tadātmanaḥ pūjāṁ
vijñāya vihatāṁ nṛpa
gopebhyaḥ kṛṣṇa-nāthebhyo
nandādibhyaś cukopa ha
Synonyms
śrī-śukaḥ uvāca — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; indraḥ — Lord Indra; tadā — then; ātmanaḥ — his own; pūjām — worship; vijñāya — understanding; vihatām — diverted; nṛpa — O King (Parīkṣit); gopebhyaḥ — at the cowherds; kṛṣṇa-nāthebhyaḥ — who took Kṛṣṇa as their Lord; nanda-ādibhyaḥ — headed by Nanda Mahārāja; cukopa ha — he became angry.
Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King Parīkṣit, when Indra understood that his sacrifice had been put aside, he became furious with Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherd men, who were accepting Kṛṣṇa as their Lord.
Purport
At the very beginning of this chapter Śukadeva Gosvāmī reveals the foolishness of Indra and the absurdity of his anger. Indra was frustrated because the residents of Vṛndāvana accepted Śrī Kṛṣṇa as their Lord. But the simple fact is that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Lord, not only of the residents of Vṛndāvana but of all that exists, including Indra himself. Thus Indra’s petulant reaction was ridiculous. As the common saying goes, “Pride goes before a fall.”

गणं सांवर्तकं नाम मेघानां चान्तकारीणाम् । इन्द्र: प्रचोदयत् क्रुद्धो वाक्यं चाहेशमान्युत ॥ २ ॥
gaṇaṁ sāṁvartakaṁ nāma
meghānāṁ cānta-kārīṇām
indraḥ pracodayat kruddho
vākyaṁ cāheśa-māny uta
Synonyms
gaṇam — the group; sāṁvartakam nāma — named Sāṁvartaka; meghānām — of clouds; ca — and; anta-kāriṇām — who effect the end of the universe; indraḥ — Indra; pracodayat — sent forth; kruddhaḥ — angry; vākyam — words; ca — and; āha — spoke; īśa-mānī — falsely thinking himself the supreme controller; uta — indeed.
Translation
Angry Indra sent forth the clouds of universal destruction, known as Sāṁvartaka. Imagining himself the supreme controller, he spoke as follows.
Purport
The word īśa-mānī here is very significant. Indra arrogantly considered himself to be the Lord, and thus he exhibited the typical attitude of a conditioned soul. Many thinkers in the twentieth century have noted the exaggerated sense of individual prestige characteristic of our culture; indeed, writers have even coined the phrase “the me generation.” Everyone in this world is more or less guilty of the syndrome called īśa-māna, or proudly considering oneself the Lord.

gopānāṁ kānanaukasām
kṛṣṇaṁ martyam upāśritya
ye cakrur deva-helanam
Synonyms
aho — just see; śrī — because of opulence; mada — of intoxication; māhātmyam — the great extent; gopānām — of the cowherds; kānana — in the forest; okasām — who dwell; kṛṣṇam — Kṛṣṇa; martyam — an ordinary human; upāśritya — taking shelter of; ye — who; cakruḥ — have committed; deva — against the demigods; helanam — offense.
Translation
[Indra said:] Just see how these cowherd men living in the forest have become so greatly intoxicated by their prosperity! They have surrendered to an ordinary human being, Kṛṣṇa, and thus they have offended the gods.
Purport
Of course, Indra was really saying that the cowherd men had offended him, Indra, by taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa, whom Indra considered to be martya, a mortal. This was certainly a gross miscalculation on Indra’s part.

Translation
Their taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa is just like the foolish attempt of men who abandon transcendental knowledge of the self and instead try to cross over the great ocean of material existence in the false boats of fruitive, ritual sacrifices.

वाचालं बालिशं स्तब्धमज्ञं पण्डितमानिनम् । कृष्णं मर्त्यमुपाश्रित्य गोपा मे चक्रुरप्रियम् ॥ ५ ॥
vācālaṁ bāliśaṁ stabdham
ajñaṁ paṇḍita-māninam
kṛṣṇaṁ martyam upāśritya
gopā me cakrur apriyam
Synonyms

Translation
These cowherd men have acted inimically toward me by taking shelter of this ordinary human being, Kṛṣṇa, who thinks Himself very wise but who is simply a foolish, arrogant, overtalkative child.
Purport
According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, through the insults of Indra Goddess Sarasvatī is actually praising Kṛṣṇa. The ācārya explains: “Vācālam means ‘one who can speak according to Vedic authority.’ Bāliśam means ‘free from pretension, just like a child.’ Stabdham means that He bows down to no one because there is no one for Him to offer homage to, ajñam means that there is nothing more for Him to know because He is omniscient, paṇḍita-māninam means that He is highly honored by the knowers of the Absolute Truth, and kṛṣṇam means He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, whose transcendental form is full of eternity and ecstasy. Martyam means that although He is the Absolute Truth, He nevertheless appears in this world as a human being out of affection for His devotees.”
Indra wanted to rebuke Kṛṣṇa as vācālam because the Lord had presented many audacious arguments in the line of Karma-mīmāṁsā and Sāṅkhya philosophy even though He did not accept these arguments; thus Indra called the Lord bāliśa, “foolish.” Indra called Him stabdha because He had spoken boldly even in the presence of His own father. Thus although Indra attempted to criticize Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord’s transcendental character is in fact impeccable, and this chapter will demonstrate how Indra came to recognize the position of the Lord.

एषां श्रियावलिप्तानां कृष्णेनाध्मापितात्मनाम् । धुनुत श्रीमदस्तम्भं पशून् नयत सङ्‌क्षयम् ॥ ६ ॥
eṣāṁ śriyāvaliptānāṁ
kṛṣṇenādhmāpitātmanām
dhunuta śrī-mada-stambhaṁ

Synonyms
eṣām — of them; śriyā — by their opulences; avaliptānām — who are intoxicated; kṛṣṇena — by Kṛṣṇa; ādhmāpita — fortified; ātmanām — whose hearts; dhunuta — remove; śrī — based on their wealth; mada — being maddened; stambham — their false pride; paśūn — their animals; nayata — bring; saṅkṣayam — to destruction.
Translation
[To the clouds of destruction King Indra said:] The prosperity of these people has made them mad with pride, and their arrogance is backed up by Kṛṣṇa. Now go and remove their pride and bring their animals to destruction.
Purport
It is clear from this verse that the residents of Vṛndāvana had become highly prosperous simply by protecting cows, since Indra wanted to destroy their so-called pride based on wealth by killing their animals. Well-tended cows produce large quantities of milk, from which come cheese, butter, yogurt, ghee and so on. These foods are delicious by themselves and also enhance other foods, such as fruits, vegetables and grains. Bread and vegetables are delicious with butter, and fruit is especially appetizing when mixed with cream or yogurt. Dairy products are always desirable in civilized society, and the surplus can be traded for many valuable commodities. Thus, simply by a Vedic dairy enterprise, the residents of Vṛndāvana were wealthy, healthy and happy, even in the material sense, and most of all they were eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Purport
The Sāṁvartaka clouds were frightened by Indra’s powerful mood and thus carried out his order, as described in the following verse.

Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: On Indra’s order the clouds of universal destruction, released untimely from their bonds, went to the cowherd pastures of Nanda Mahārāja. There they began to torment the inhabitants by powerfully pouring down torrents of rain upon them.
Purport
The Sāṁvartaka clouds could cover the entire earth with a single vast ocean. With great strength, these clouds began flooding the simple land of Vraja.

Purport
At the time of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s birth, Garga Muni had predicted, anena sarva-durgāṇi yūyam añjas tariṣyathā (Bhāg. 10.8.16): “By His grace you will easily cross beyond all difficulties.” The residents of Vṛndāvana were confident that in such a great emergency Lord Śrī Nārāyaṇa would empower Kṛṣṇa to protect them. They accepted Kṛṣṇa as everything, and Kṛṣṇa reciprocated their love.

Translation
Seeing the inhabitants of His Gokula rendered practically unconscious by the onslaught of hail and blasting wind, the Supreme Lord Hari understood that this was the work of angry Indra.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that the severe distress Indra apparently inflicted upon the residents of Vṛndāvana was an arrangement made by Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pastime potency to enhance the loving dealings between the residents and the Lord. The ācārya gives the analogy that for a hungry person, the pain of hunger increases the happiness he feels when he finally eats excellent food, and thus hunger can be said to enhance the pleasure of eating. Similarly, the residents of Vṛndāvana, although not experiencing ordinary, material anxiety, felt a type of distress at the activities of Indra and thus intensified their meditation on Kṛṣṇa. When the Lord finally acted, the result was wonderful.

By My mystic power I will completely counteract this disturbance caused by Indra. Demigods like Indra are proud of their opulence, and out of foolishness they falsely consider themselves the Lord of the universe. I will now destroy such ignorance.

न हि सद्भ‍ावयुक्तानां सुराणामीशविस्मय: । मत्तोऽसतां मानभङ्ग: प्रशमायोपकल्पते ॥ १७ ॥
na hi sad-bhāva-yuktānāṁ
surāṇām īśa-vismayaḥ
matto ’satāṁ māna-bhaṅgaḥ
praśamāyopakalpate
Synonyms
na — not; hi — certainly; sat-bhāva — with the mode of goodness; yuktānām — who are endowed; surāṇām — of the demigods; īśa — as controlling lords; vismayaḥ — false identification; mattaḥ — by Me; asatām — of the impure; māna — of the false prestige; bhaṅgaḥ — the eradication; praśamāya — for relieving them; upakalpate — is intended.
Translation
Since the demigods are endowed with the mode of goodness, the false pride of considering oneself the Lord should certainly not affect them. When I break the false prestige of those bereft of goodness, My purpose is to bring them relief.
Purport
The demigods are supposed to be sad-bhāva-yukta, endowed with spiritual existence, since they are deputed servants of the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gītā (4.24) it is stated:
brahmārpaṇaṁ brahma havir
brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam
brahmaiva tena gantavyaṁ
brahma-karma-samādhinā
“That which is duly offered to the Lord becomes spiritualized.” The demigods engage in the devotional service of the Lord by managing various departments of cosmic administration. Therefore as demigods, or as servants of the Lord, their existence is pure (sad-bhāva). When the demigods fail to live up to the high position given them by the Lord and deviate from proper behavior, they are not acting as demigods but rather as conditioned souls.
Māna, or false prestige, is certainly an anxiety-ridden burden for the conditioned soul. A falsely proud person is not truly peaceful or satisfied, because his understanding of himself is false and inflated. When a servant of the Lord becomes asat, or irreligious, the Lord saves him from impiety by breaking the false prestige that has led him to be offensive or sinful. As stated by the Lord Himself, yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ: “I give My blessings to a person by taking away his so-called opulence.”
Of course, the advanced stage of devotional service to the Lord, as described by Rūpa Gosvāmī, is yukta-vairāgya, utilizing the opulence of this world to execute the Lord’s mission. Obviously the things of this world can be used wonderfully to spread the glories of God and to create a godly society, and a more advanced devotee will not be seduced by material paraphernalia but will dutifully and honestly engage it solely for the pleasure of the Lord. In this particular case, Lord Indra forgot that he was a humble servant of God, and Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore arranged to bring this bewildered demigod to his senses.

तस्मान्मच्छरणं गोष्ठं मन्नाथं मत्परिग्रहम् । गोपाये स्वात्मयोगेन सोऽयं मे व्रत आहित: ॥ १८ ॥
tasmān mac-charaṇaṁ goṣṭhaṁ
man-nāthaṁ mat-parigraham
gopāye svātma-yogena
so ’yaṁ me vrata āhitaḥ
Synonyms
tasmāt — therefore; mat-śaraṇam — having taken shelter of Me; goṣṭham — the cowherd community; mat-nātham — who have Me as their master; mat-parigraham — My own family; gopāye — I shall protect; sva-ātma-yogena — by My personal mystic power; saḥ ayam — this; me — by Me; vrataḥ — vow; āhitaḥ — has been taken.
Translation
I must therefore protect the cowherd community by My transcendental potency, for I am their shelter, I am their master, and indeed they are My own family. After all, I have taken a vow to protect My devotees.
Purport
The word mac-charaṇam indicates not only that Lord Kṛṣṇa was the sole shelter for the vraja-jana, the people of Vṛndāvana, but also that Lord Kṛṣṇa had established His home among them. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura quotes from the Anekārtha-varga dictionary, śaraṇaṁ gṛha-rakṣitroḥ: “The word śaraṇam can represent either home or protector.” The residents of Vṛndāvana adopted Kṛṣṇa as their beloved child, friend, lover and life itself, and the Lord reciprocated their feelings. Thus Śrī Kṛṣṇa lived among these fortunate people, moving in their houses and fields; naturally He would protect such intimate devotees from all types of danger.

Translation
Having said this, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is Viṣṇu Himself, picked up Govardhana Hill with one hand and held it aloft just as easily as a child holds up a mushroom.
Purport
It is confirmed in the Hari-vaṁśa that Śrī Kṛṣṇa picked up the Govardhana Mountain with His left hand: sa dhṛtaḥ saṅgato meghair giriḥ savyena pāṇinā. “With His left hand He picked up that mountain, which was touching the clouds.” According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, when Lord Kṛṣṇa was preparing to lift Govardhana Hill, a partial expansion of His Yoga-māyā potency named Saṁhārikī temporarily removed all the rain from the sky so that as He ran very swiftly from the porch of His house to the mountain, neither His turban nor other garments became wet.

athāha bhagavān gopān

Synonyms
atha — then; āha — addressed; bhagavān — the Supreme Lord; gopān — the cowherds; he — O; amba — mother; tāta — O father; vraja-okasaḥ — O residents of Vraja; yathā-upajoṣam — as suits your pleasure; viśata — please enter; giri — this hill; gartam — the empty space below; sa-godhanāḥ — together with your cows.
Translation
The Lord then addressed the cowherd community: O Mother, O Father, O residents of Vraja, if you wish you may now come under this hill with your cows.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura provides the following insight in this regard: Ordinarily a large cowherd community, which included many thousands of cows, calves, bulls and so on, could not fit under the base of a medium-sized hill like Śrī Govardhana. However, because the hill was in ecstasy, being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it acquired inconceivable power and even felt the hundreds of deadly thunderbolts thrown upon its back by angry Indra to be offerings of soft, fragrant flowers. At times Śrī Govardhana was not even aware that the thunderbolts were striking. From the Hari-vaṁśa the ācārya has also quoted Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself as saying, trai-lokyam apy utsahate rakṣituṁ kiṁ punar vrajam: “Śrī Govardhana can give shelter to all the three worlds, what to speak of the simple land of Vraja.”
When Indra’s attack began and Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill, the deer, wild hogs, and other animals and birds standing on the hill’s flanks climbed up to its peaks, and even they did not experience the slightest distress.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, forgetting hunger and thirst and putting aside all considerations of personal pleasure, stood there holding up the hill for seven days as the people of Vraja gazed upon Him.
Purport
According to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa:
vrajaika-vāsibhir harṣa-
vismitākṣair niṛīkṣitaḥ
gopa-gopī-janair hṛṣṭaiḥ
prīti-visphāritekṣaṇaiḥ
saṁstūyamāna-caritaḥ
kṛṣṇaḥ śailam adhārayat
“Lord Kṛṣṇa held up the mountain while His praises were chanted by the residents of Vraja, all of whom now had the opportunity to dwell together with Him, and who glanced at Him with joyful and amazed eyes. Thus the cowherd men and women were all elated, and out of loving affection they opened their eyes wide.”
By continuously drinking the nectar of the beauty and sweetness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the residents of Vṛndāvana felt no hunger, thirst or fatigue, and Lord Kṛṣṇa, by seeing their beautiful forms, also forgot about eating, drinking and sleeping. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that seven days of continuous rain from the Sāṁvartaka clouds failed to flood the district of Mathurā because the Supreme Lord, simply by His potency, immediately dried up the water as it fell to the ground. Thus Kṛṣṇa’s lifting of Govardhana Hill is full of fascinating details and has for thousands of years remained one of His most famous pastimes.

All the residents of Vṛndāvana were overwhelmed with ecstatic love, and they came forward and greeted Śrī Kṛṣṇa according to their individual relationships with Him — some embracing Him, others bowing down to Him, and so forth. The cowherd women presented water mixed with yogurt and unbroken barleycorns as a token of honor, and they showered auspicious benedictions upon Him.
Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that each of the residents of Vṛndāvana regarded Kṛṣṇa in his own way — as an inferior, younger member of the community; as an equal; or as a superior — and they dealt with Him accordingly. Kṛṣṇa’s superiors offered auspicious benedictions, lovingly smelled His head, kissed Him, rubbed His arms and fingers, and inquired with parental affection as to whether He was tired or pained. Kṛṣṇa’s equals laughed or joked with Him, and those who were younger fell at His feet, massaged His feet, and so on.
The word ca in this verse indicates that the wives of the brāhmaṇas joined with the cowherd ladies to offer auspicious items like yogurt and unbroken grains. Lord Kṛṣṇa received benedictions such as this: “May You subdue the wicked, protect the decent people, give pleasure to Your parents and be enriched with all wealth and opulence.”

Translation
Surrounded by His loving cowherd boyfriends and Lord Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa then went off to the place where He had been tending His cows. The cowherd girls returned to their homes, singing joyfully about the lifting of Govardhana Hill and other glorious deeds performed by Lord Kṛṣṇa, who had so deeply touched their hearts.
Purport
Before returning to their homes, the gopīs shared intimate association with their lover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, by exchanging secret glances. Ordinarily they could not publicly talk about Kṛṣṇa, since they were chaste young girls in a religious village, but now they took advantage of this wonderful exhibition by the Lord and freely sang of His beautiful qualities. It is natural that a young man wants to do something wonderful in the presence of a beautiful young girl. The gopīs were the most beautiful and pure-hearted young girls, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa performed the most wonderful activities in their presence. Thus He entered deep within their tender hearts, enlivening their eternal devotion to Him.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “Lord Kṛṣṇa Lifts Govardhana Hill.”
