CHAPTER SEVENTY

Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Daily Activities
This chapter describes Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s daily activities and two proposals placed before Him — one by a messenger from Dvārakā and another by the sage Nārada.
In the early hours of the morning, Lord Kṛṣṇa would rise from bed and bathe Himself in clear water. After executing the dawn rituals and other religious duties, He would offer oblations into the sacred fire, chant the Gāyatrī mantra, worship and pay tribute to the demigods, sages and forefathers, and offer respects to learned brāhmaṇas. Then He would touch auspicious substances, decorate Himself with celestial ornaments and gratify His subjects by giving them whatever they desired.
The Lord’s chariot driver, Dāruka, would bring His chariot, and the Lord would mount it and drive to the royal assembly hall. When He would take His seat in the assembly, surrounded by the Yādavas, He would appear like the moon surrounded by the circle of stars called nakṣatras. Bards would recite His praises to the accompaniment of drums, cymbals, vīṇās and other instruments.
On one occasion, the doorkeepers escorted a messenger into the assembly hall. The messenger offered prostrated obeisances to the Lord and then, standing with joined palms, addressed Him: “O Lord, Jarāsandha has captured twenty thousand kings and is holding them prisoner. Please do something, for these kings are all Your surrendered devotees.”
Just at that moment Nārada Muni appeared. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and all the members of the assembly stood up and offered obeisances to Nārada by bowing their heads. The sage accepted a seat, and then Lord Kṛṣṇa gently questioned him: “Since you travel all over the universe, please inform Us what the Pāṇḍava brothers are planning to do.” Nārada then praised the Supreme Lord and replied, “King Yudhiṣṭhira desires to perform the Rājasūya sacrifice. For this he requests Your sanction and presence. Many demigods and illustrious kings will come just to see You.”
Understanding that the Yādavas wanted Him to defeat Jarāsandha, Lord Kṛṣṇa asked His wise minister Uddhava to determine which of the two matters at hand — the defeat of Jarāsandha or the Rājasūya sacrifice — should be attended to first.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: As dawn approached, the wives of Lord Mādhava, each embraced around the neck by her husband, cursed the crowing roosters. The ladies were disturbed that now they would be separated from Him.
Purport
This description of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s daily activities starts with the crowing of the rooster. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives knew that the Lord would dutifully get up and perform His prescribed morning rituals, and thus they were agitated at their coming separation from Him and cursed the roosters.

Synonyms
brāhme muhūrte — during the most suitable period of the day for spiritual activity, before sunrise; utthāya — rising; vāri — water; upaspṛśya — touching; mādhavaḥ — Lord Kṛṣṇa; dadhyau — meditated; prasanna — clear; karaṇaḥ — His mind; ātmānam — upon Himself; tamasaḥ — ignorance; param — beyond; ekam — exclusive; svayam-jyotiḥ — self-luminous; ananyam — without another; avyayam — infallible; sva-saṁsthayā — by His own nature; nitya — perpetually; nirasta — dispelling; kalmaṣam — contamination; brahma-ākhyam — known as Brahman, the Absolute Truth; asya — of this (universe); udbhava — of creation; nāśa — and destruction; hetubhiḥ — by the causes; sva — His own; śaktibhiḥ — energies; lakṣita — manifest; bhāva — existence; nirvṛtim — joy.
Translation
Lord Mādhava would rise during the brāhma-muhūrta period and touch water. With a clear mind He would then meditate upon Himself, the single, self-luminous, unequaled and infallible Supreme Truth, known as Brahman, who by His very nature ever dispels all contamination, and who through His personal energies, which cause the creation and destruction of this universe, manifests His own pure and blissful existence.
Purport
Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that the word bhāva in this verse indicates the created beings. Thus the compound word lakṣita-bhāva-nirvṛtim means that Lord Kṛṣṇa gives pleasure to the created beings through His various energies. Of course, the soul is never created, but our material, conditioned existence is created by the interaction of the Lord’s energies.
One who is favored by the Lord’s internal potency can understand the nature of the Absolute Truth; this understanding is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Bhagavad-gītā Lord Kṛṣṇa explains that His energies are divided into inferior and superior, or material and spiritual, potencies. The Brahma-saṁhitā further explains that the material potency acts like a shadow, following the movements of the spiritual reality, which is the Lord Himself and His spiritual potency. When one is favored by Lord Kṛṣṇa, He reveals Himself to the surrendered soul, and thus the same creation that formerly covered the soul becomes an impetus for spiritual enlightenment.

Purport
Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that since Lord Kṛṣṇa was in the disciplic succession from Kaṇva Muni, He offered oblations to the fire before sunrise. Then He chanted the Gāyatrī mantra.

Translation
Each day the Lord worshiped the rising sun and propitiated the demigods, sages and forefathers, who are all His expansions. The self-possessed Lord would then carefully worship His elders and the brāhmaṇas. To those well-attired brāhmaṇas He would offer herds of tame and peaceful cows with gold-plated horns and pearl necklaces. These cows were also dressed in fine cloth, and the fronts of their hooves were plated with silver. Providers of abundant milk, they had each given birth only once and were accompanied by their calves. Daily the Lord gave many groups of 13,084 cows to the learned brāhmaṇas, together with linen, deerskins and sesame seeds.
Purport
Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes several Vedic scriptures to show that in the context of Vedic ritual, a badva here refers to 13,084 cows. The words badvaṁ badvaṁ dine dine indicate that Lord Kṛṣṇa would give the learned brāhmaṇas many such groups of cows on a daily basis. Śrīdhara Svāmī further gives evidence that the usual practice for great saintly kings in previous ages was to give 107 such badva, or groups of 13,084 cows. Thus the total number of cows given in this sacrifice, known as Mañcāra, is 14 lakhs, or 1,400,000.
The words alaṅkṛtebhyo viprebhyaḥ indicate that in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s kingdom the brāhmaṇas were given nice clothes and ornaments and were thus well attired.
In Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrīla Prabhupāda writes with striking and profound insight on these pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The reader is strongly urged to study this book, which contains an invaluable wealth of information and commentary on the pastimes described in the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Our humble attempt here can never equal the consummate purity and skill of our great master. Still, as a service offered at his lotus feet, we are simply presenting the original Sanskrit text of the Tenth Canto, word-for-word meanings, a clear translation and essential commentary, for the most part based on the statements of the great spiritual masters in our line.

I am coming back later today to enjoy with you.’ And then, with His smile captivating their minds, He got away only with difficulty, freeing Himself from the bondage of their loving glances.”

Purport
Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “It may be remembered that the Sudharmā assembly house was taken away from the heavenly planet and was reestablished in the city of Dvārakā. The specific significance of the assembly house was that anyone who entered it would be free from the six kinds of material pangs, namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. These are the waves of material existence, and as long as one remained in that assembly house of Sudharmā, he would not be affected by these six material waves.”
In this regard, Śrīdhara Svāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī explain that when Lord Kṛṣṇa would exit separately from each of His many palaces, each individual form would be visible to the persons present on those particular palace grounds and to the neighboring residents, but not to others. Then, at the gateway path of the Sudharmā assembly hall, all the forms of the Lord would merge into a single form, and thus He would enter the hall.

Purport
Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the kings present their entreaty in this and the following five verses. In this verse they take shelter of the Lord, in the next three verses they describe their fear, and in the last two verses they make their prayerful request.

Translation
People in this world are always engaged in sinful activities and are thus bewildered about their real duty, which is to worship You according to Your commandments. This activity would truly bring them good fortune. Let us offer our obeisances unto the all-powerful Lord, who appears as time and suddenly cuts down one’s stubborn hope for a long life in this world.
Purport
Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the Bhagavad-gītā (9.27):
yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi
yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam
“Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform — do that, O son of Kuntī, as an offering to Me.”
This is the Supreme Lord’s commandment, but people in general are bewildered and neglect this auspicious activity, preferring instead to perform sinful activities that lead them to terrible suffering. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is working to enlighten the world about this most essential activity of loving service to the Lord.

Synonyms
loke — into this world; bhavān — You; jagat — of the universe; inaḥ — the predominator; kalayā — with Your expansion Baladeva, or with Your time potency; avatīrṇaḥ — having descended; sat — the saintly; rakṣaṇāya — to protect; khala — the wicked; nigrahaṇāya — to subdue; ca — and; anyaḥ — other; kaścit — someone; tvadīyam — Your; atiyāti — transgresses; nideśam — the law; īśa — O Lord; kim vā — or else; janaḥ — a person; sva — by himself; kṛtam — created; ṛcchati — obtains; tat — that; na vidmaḥ — we do not understand.
Translation
You are the predominating Lord of the universe and have descended into this world with Your personal power to protect the saintly and suppress the wicked. We cannot understand, O Lord, how anyone can transgress Your law and still continue to enjoy the fruits of his work.
Purport
Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the kings were bewildered by the suffering that had come upon them. They state here that since the Lord has descended to this world to protect the pious and punish the wicked, how is it that Jarāsandha, who brazenly transgressed the order of the Lord, continued to perform his wicked activities, whereas the kings were put into a miserable condition? Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura similarly states that the kings could not understand how Jarāsandha, who harassed the saintly devotees and nourished the envious, could continue to prosper, whereas the kings were being tormented by the wicked Jarāsandha. Similarly Śrīla Prabhupāda quotes the kings as follows in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead: “My dear Lord, You are the proprietor of all the worlds, and You have incarnated Yourself along with Your plenary expansion Lord Balarāma. It is said that Your appearance in this incarnation is for the purpose of protecting the faithful and destroying the miscreants. Under the circumstances, how is it possible that miscreants like Jarāsandha can put us into such deplorable conditions of life against Your authority? We are puzzled at the situation and cannot understand how it is possible. It may be that Jarāsandha has been deputed to give us such trouble because of our past misdeeds, but we have heard from revealed scriptures that anyone who surrenders unto Your lotus feet immediately becomes immune to the reactions of sinful life… [We] therefore… wholeheartedly offer ourselves unto Your shelter, and we hope that Your Lordship will now give us full protection.”

svapnāyitam — like a dream; nṛpa — of kings; sukham — the happiness; para-tantram — conditional; īśa — O Lord; śaśvat — perpetually; bhayena — full of fear; mṛtakena — with this corpse; dhuram — burden; vahāmaḥ — we carry; hitvā — rejecting; tat — that; ātmani — within the self; sukham — happiness; tvat — done for You; anīha — by selfless works; labhyam — to be obtained; kliśyāmahe — we suffer; ati — extremely; kṛpaṇāḥ — wretched; tava — Your; māyayā — with the illusory energy; iha — in this world.
Translation
O Lord, with this corpselike body, always full of fear, we bear the burden of the relative happiness of kings, which is just like a dream. Thus we have rejected the real happiness of the soul, which comes by rendering selfless service to You. Being so very wretched, we simply suffer in this life under the spell of Your illusory energy.
Purport
After expressing their doubts in the previous verse, the kings herein admit that actually they are suffering because of their own foolishness, having given up the eternal happiness of the soul in exchange for the temporary, conditional happiness of a so-called kingly position. Most people make a similar mistake, desiring wealth, power, prestige, aristocratic family and so on, in exchange for their own soul. The kings admit that they have fallen under the spell of the Lord’s illusory energy and have mistaken the tremendous anxiety of political leadership for happiness.

Purport
The kings here pray for the Lord to release them from the bondage of karma created by the Lord’s material potency. The kings make it clear that Jarāsandha is so powerful that there is no hope for them to escape by their own power.

Synonyms
yaḥ — who; vai — indeed; tvayā — by You; dvi — twice; nava — nine; kṛtvaḥ — times; udātta — upraised; cakra — O You whose disc weapon; bhagnaḥ — crushed; mṛdhe — in battle; khalu — surely; bhavantam — You; ananta — unlimited; vīryam — whose power; jitvā — defeating; nr-loka — in human affairs; niratam — absorbed; sakṛt — only once; ūḍha — inflated; darpaḥ — whose pride; yuṣmat — Your; prajāḥ — subjects; rujati — torments; naḥ — us; ajita — O unconquerable one; tat — that; vidhehi — please rectify.
Translation
O wielder of the disc! Your strength is unlimited, and thus seventeen times You crushed Jarāsandha in battle. But then, absorbed in human affairs, You allowed him to defeat You once. Now he is so filled with pride that he dares to torment us, Your subjects. O unconquerable one, please rectify this situation.
Purport
The word nṛ-loka-niratam indicates that the Lord was absorbed in playing within the world of human beings. Thus, while acting like a human king He allowed Jarāsandha to be victorious in a single battle after the Lord had crushed him seventeen times. The kings here imply that Jarāsandha is especially harassing them because they are souls surrendered to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they beg the Lord, “O You who hold the cakra weapon high, please make the proper arrangement.”
Śrīla Prabhupāda expresses the kings’ feelings as follows: “My dear Lord, You have already fought with Jarāsandha eighteen times consecutively, out of which You have defeated him seventeen times by surpassing his extraordinary powerful position. But in Your eighteenth fight You exhibited Your human behavior, and thus it appeared that You were defeated. My dear Lord, we know very well that Jarāsandha cannot defeat You at any time, because Your power, strength, resources and authority are all unlimited. No one can equal You or surpass You. The appearance of defeat by Jarāsandha in the eighteenth engagement is nothing but an exhibition of human behavior. Unfortunately, foolish Jarāsandha could not understand Your tricks, and he has since then become puffed up over his material power and prestige. Specifically, he has arrested us and imprisoned us, knowing fully that as Your devotees, we are subordinate to Your sovereignty.”

Purport
When Lord Kṛṣṇa questioned Nārada Muni about the intentions of the Pāṇḍavas, the sage replied that the Lord is Himself all-powerful and all-knowing, even to the extent that He can bewilder the creator of the universe, Brahmā. Nārada understood that Lord Kṛṣṇa desired to kill Jarāsandha and was thus beginning to arrange for this pastime by inquiring from Nārada about the Pāṇḍavas’ intentions. Understanding the Lord’s own intention, Nārada was not astonished when Lord Kṛṣṇa humbly requested information from him.

Who can properly understand Your purpose? With Your material energy You expand and also withdraw this creation, which thus appears to have substantial existence. Obeisances to You, whose transcendental position is inconceivable.
Purport
Śrīla Prabhupāda explains Nārada’s realization as follows: “My dear Lord, by Your inconceivable potencies You create this cosmic manifestation, maintain it and again dissolve it. It is by dint of Your inconceivable potency only that this material world, although a shadow representation of the spiritual world, appears to be factual. No one can understand what You plan to do in the future. Your transcendental position is always inconceivable to everyone. As far as I am concerned, I can simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again.”
The word sva-vilakṣaṇātmane also indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa has His own unique nature and characteristics. No one is equal to God or greater than God.

But You, the Supreme Lord, descend to this world in various personal forms, and by performing Your pastimes You illumine the soul’s path with the blazing torch of Your fame. Therefore I surrender unto You.
Purport
Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “[Nārada said,] In the bodily concept of existence, everyone is driven by material desires, and thus everyone develops new material bodies one after another in the cycle of birth and death. Being absorbed in such a concept of existence, one does not know how to get out of the encagement of the material body. Out of Your causeless mercy, my Lord, You descend to exhibit Your different transcendental pastimes, which are illuminating and full of glory. Therefore I have no alternative but to offer my respectful obeisances unto You. My dear Lord, You are the Supreme, Parabrahman, and Your pastimes as an ordinary human are another tactical resource, exactly like a play on the stage in which the actor plays parts different from his own identity.”

King Yudhiṣṭhira is described here as pārameṣṭhya-kāma, or “desiring pārameṣṭhya.” The word pārameṣṭhya means “unrivaled supremacy” and also indicates “the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who stands at the very height of all existence.” Therefore, Śrīla Prabhupāda translates Nārada’s message as follows: “You have inquired about Your cousins the Pāṇḍavas in the role of their well-wisher, and therefore I shall let You know about their intentions. Now please hear me. First of all, may I inform You that King Yudhiṣṭhira has all material opulences that are possible to achieve in the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka. He has no material opulence for which to aspire, and yet he wants to perform the Rājasūya sacrifice only to get Your association and to please You.… He wants to worship You in order to achieve Your causeless mercy, and I beg to request You to fulfill his desires.”
Since the word pārameṣṭhya may also indicate the position of Lord Brahmā, the term pārameṣṭhya-kāma is taken here by Śrīla Prabhupāda to indicate not only that King Yudhiṣṭhira desired Lord Kṛṣṇa’s association and mercy but also that King Yudhiṣṭhira himself possessed pārameṣṭhya, all the opulences of Lord Brahmā.

Translation
My dear Lord, You are the symbol of everything auspicious. Your transcendental name and fame is spread like a canopy all over the universe, including the higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The transcendental water that washes Your lotus feet is known in the higher planetary systems as the Mandākinī River, in the lower planetary systems as the Bhogavatī and in this earthly planetary system as the Ganges. This sacred, transcendental water flows throughout the entire universe, purifying wherever it goes.
Purport
This translation is based on Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Kṛṣṇa. Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions that the word dig-vitānam indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental glories spread throughout the universe like a cooling canopy over the universal directions. In other words, the whole world can find shelter under the cooling shade of the Lord’s lotus feet. Thus the Lord is bhuvana-maṅgala, the symbol of everything auspicious for this world.

Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: When His supporters, the Yādavas, objected to this proposal out of eagerness to defeat Jarāsandha, Lord Keśava turned to His servant Uddhava and, smiling, addressed him with fine words.
Purport
Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, “Just before the great sage Nārada arrived in the Sudharmā assembly house of Dvārakā, Lord Kṛṣṇa and His ministers and secretaries had been considering how to attack the kingdom of Jarāsandha. Because they were seriously considering this subject, Nārada’s proposal that Lord Kṛṣṇa go to Hastināpura for Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira’s great Rājasūya sacrifice did not much appeal to them. Lord Kṛṣṇa could understand the intentions of His associates because He is the ruler of even Lord Brahmā. Therefore, in order to pacify them, He smilingly [spoke] to Uddhava.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the Lord smiled because He was about to demonstrate Uddhava’s brilliant ability to give counsel in difficult situations.
