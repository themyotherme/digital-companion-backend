CHAPTER FORTY-NINE

Akrūra’s Mission in Hastināpura
This chapter describes how Akrūra went to Hastināpura, saw Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s unfair behavior toward his nephews, the Pāṇḍavas, and then returned to Mathurā.
On the order of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Akrūra went to Hastināpura, where he met the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas and then set about to find out how Dhṛtarāṣṭra was treating the latter. This task would keep Akrūra in Hastināpura for several months.
Vidura and Kuntīdevī described to Akrūra in detail how Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s sons, envious of the exalted qualities of the Pāṇḍavas, had tried to destroy them by various evil means and were contemplating further atrocities. With tearful eyes, Kuntīdevī asked Akrūra, “Do my parents and other relatives, headed by Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, ever think of me and my sons, and will Kṛṣṇa ever come to console us in our distress?” Then Kuntīdevī began to chant Lord Kṛṣṇa’s names for her protection, and she also chanted mantras expressing surrender to Him. Akrūra assured Kuntīdevī, “Since your sons were born from demigods like Dharma and Vāyu, there is no reason to expect that any misfortune will befall them; rather, you should be confident that very soon they will receive the greatest possible good fortune.”
Akrūra then delivered to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the message from Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Akrūra told the King, “You have assumed the royal throne after the death of Pāṇḍu. Seeing all equally, which is the religious duty of kings, you should protect all your subjects and personal relations. By such fair behavior you will gain all fame and good fortune. But if you act otherwise, you will attain only infamy in this life and condemnation to a hellish existence in the next. A living being takes his birth all alone, and alone he gives up his life. Alone he enjoys the fruits of his piety and sin. If one fails to understand the true identity of the self and instead maintains his progeny by indulging in evil deeds, then surely he will go to hell. One should therefore learn to understand the unsteadiness of material existence, which is like a sleeper’s dream, a magician’s illusion or a flight of fancy, and should thus control his mind in order to remain peaceful and equipoised.”
To this Dhṛtarāṣṭra replied, “I cannot hear enough of your beneficial words, O Akrūra, which are like the sweet nectar of immortality. But because the tight knot of affection for my sons has made me biased toward them, your statements cannot become fixed within my mind. No one can transgress the arrangement of the Supreme Lord; His purpose for descending into the Yadu dynasty will inevitably be fulfilled.”
Knowing now the mentality of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Akrūra took permission from his dear relatives and friends and returned to Mathurā, where he related everything to Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma.

Kuntī and Vidura also told Akrūra about how the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra had tried to poison the Pāṇḍavas and carry out other such plots.

Translation
Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa! O great yogi! O Supreme Soul and protector of the universe! O Govinda! Please protect me, who have surrendered to You. I and my sons are being overwhelmed by trouble.
Purport
“Since Lord Kṛṣṇa maintains the entire universe,” thought Kuntīdevī, “surely He can protect our family.” The word avasīdatīm indicates that Kuntīdevī was overwhelmed by troubles; thus exhausted, she was helplessly taking shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In her prayers in the First Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Kuntī admits that all these troubles were actually a blessing, for they forced her to always be intensely Kṛṣṇa conscious.

नम: कृष्णाय शुद्धाय ब्रह्मणे परमात्मने ।
योगेश्वराय योगाय त्वामहं शरणं गता ॥ १३ ॥
namaḥ kṛṣṇāya śuddhāya
brahmaṇe paramātmane
yogeśvarāya yogāya
tvām ahaṁ śaraṇaṁ gatā
Synonyms
namaḥ — obeisances; kṛṣṇāya — to Kṛṣṇa; śuddhāya — the pure; brahmaṇe — the Absolute Truth; parama-ātmane — the Supersoul; yoga — of pure devotional service; īśvarāya — the controller; yogāya — the source of all knowledge; tvām — You; aham — I; śaraṇam — for shelter; gatā — have approached.
Translation
I offer my obeisances unto You, Kṛṣṇa, the supreme pure, the Absolute Truth and the Supersoul, the Lord of pure devotional service and the source of all knowledge. I have come to You for shelter.
Purport
Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has translated the word yogāya as “unto Kṛṣṇa, the source of knowledge.” The word yoga indicates connection and also the means to achieve something. As conscious souls, we have a connection with the Supreme Soul through bhakti, or devotion. Through that relationship we experience perfect knowledge of the Supreme Soul. Since the Supreme Soul is the Absolute Truth, perfect knowledge of Him means perfect knowledge of everything. As stated in the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (1.3), yasmin vijñāte sarvam evam vijñātaṁ bhavati: When the Absolute is understood, everything is understood. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, by His spiritual potency, establishes our connection with Him, and that connection is the source of all spiritual knowledge. Thus Ācārya Śrīdhara, by his thoughtful translation, stimulates us to deeper understanding of Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy.

Translation

Translation
Both Akrūra, who shared Queen Kuntī’s distress and happiness, and the illustrious Vidura consoled the Queen by reminding her of the extraordinary way her sons had taken birth.
Purport
Akrūra and Vidura reminded Queen Kuntī that her sons were born of heavenly gods and thus could not be vanquished like ordinary mortals. In fact, an extraordinary victory awaited this most pious family.
Text 16
यास्यन् राजानमभ्येत्य विषमं पुत्रलालसम् ।

yāsyan rājānam abhyetya
viṣamaṁ putra-lālasam

Translation
The ardent affection King Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt for his sons had made him act unjustly toward the Pāṇḍavas. Just before leaving, Akrūra approached the King, who was seated among his friends and supporters, and related to him the message that his relatives — Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma — had sent out of friendship.

Translation
Akrūra said: O my dear son of Vicitravīrya, O enhancer of the Kurus’ glory, your brother Pāṇḍu having passed away, you have now assumed the royal throne.
Purport
Akrūra was speaking ironically, since the young sons of Pāṇḍu should actually have been occupying the throne. Upon the death of Pāṇḍu, they were too young to immediately govern and so were put in Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s care, but now sufficient time had passed, and their legitimate rights should have been recognized.

Translation
By religiously protecting the earth, delighting your subjects with your noble character, and treating all your relatives equally, you will surely achieve success and glory.
Purport
Akrūra told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that even though he had usurped the throne, if he now ruled according to the principles of dharma and behaved properly, he could be successful.

Translation
If you act otherwise, however, people will condemn you in this world, and in the next life you will enter the darkness of hell. Remain equally disposed, therefore, toward Pāṇḍu’s sons and your own.
Purport
Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s whole problem was his excessive attachment to his nasty sons. That was the fatal flaw that caused his downfall. There was no lack of good advice from all sides, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra even admitted that the advice was sound, but he could not follow it. One can have clear, practical intelligence when the mind and heart are pure.

Translation
In this world no one has any permanent relationship with anyone else, O King. We cannot stay forever even with our own body, what to speak of our wife, children and the rest.

एक: प्रसूयते जन्तुरेक एव प्रलीयते ।

ekaḥ prasūyate jantur
eka eva pralīyate

eka eva ca duṣkṛtam
Synonyms
ekaḥ — alone; prasūyate — is born; jantuḥ — a living creature; ekaḥ — alone; eva — also; pralīyate — meets his demise; ekaḥ — alone; anubhuṅkte — enjoys as is due him; sukṛtam — his good reactions; ekaḥ — alone; eva ca — and surely; duṣkṛtam — bad reactions.
Translation
Every creature is born alone and dies alone, and alone one experiences the just rewards of his good and evil deeds.
Purport
The term anubhuṅkte is significant here. Bhuṅkte means “(the living being) experiences,” and anu means “following,” or “in sequence.” In other words, we experience happiness and distress according to the moral and spiritual quality of our activities. We are responsible for what we do. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was falsely and obsessively attached to his evil-minded sons, forgetting that he alone would have to suffer for his imprudent behavior.

adharmopacitaṁ vittaṁ

Synonyms
adharma — by irreligious means; upacitam — gathered; vittam — wealth; haranti — steal; anye — other persons; alpa-medhasaḥ — of one who is unintelligent; sambhojanīya — as requiring support; apadeśaiḥ — by the false designations; jalāni — water; iva — as; jala-okasaḥ — of a resident of the water.
Translation
In the guise of dear dependents, strangers steal the sinfully acquired wealth of a foolish man, just as the offspring of a fish drink up the water that sustains the fish.
Purport
Ordinary people feel they cannot live without their wealth, although their possession of it is circumstantial and temporary. Just as wealth gives life to an ordinary man, water gives life to a fish. One’s dear dependents, however, steal one’s wealth, just as a fish’s offspring drink up the water sustaining the fish. In the words of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, this world is “a weird abode.”
Text 23
पुष्णाति यानधर्मेण स्वबुद्ध्या तमपण्डितम् ।

puṣṇāti yān adharmeṇa

Translation
A fool indulges in sin to maintain his life, wealth and children and other relatives, for he thinks, “These things are mine.” In the end, however, these very things all abandon him, leaving him frustrated.
Purport
In these verses, Akrūra is giving rather frank advice to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Those who know the story of the Mahābhārata will realize how relevant and prophetic these instructions are, and how much Dhṛtarāṣṭra suffered for not accepting them. Although one tenaciously clings to his property, in the end all is lost, and the blundering soul is swept away by the wheel of birth and death.

asiddhārtho viśaty andhaṁ
sva-dharma-vimukhas tamaḥ
Synonyms
svayam — for himself; kilbiṣam — sinful reaction; ādāya — taking on; taiḥ — by them; tyaktaḥ — abandoned; na — not; artha — the purpose of his life; kovidaḥ — knowing properly; asiddha — unfulfilled; arthaḥ — whose goals; viśati — he enters; andham — blind; sva — his own; dharma — to the religious duty; vimukhaḥ — indifferent; tamaḥ — darkness (of hell).
Translation
Abandoned by his so-called dependents, ignorant of the actual goal of life, indifferent to his real duty, and having failed to fulfill his purposes, the foolish soul enters the blindness of hell, taking his sinful reactions with him.
Purport
It is sadly ironic that materialistic persons, who labor so assiduously to accumulate insurance, security, property and family, enter the darkness of hell equipped with nothing but the painful reactions of their sins. On the other hand, those who cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, spiritual life, while apparently neglecting to accumulate property, a large family and so on, enter the next life enriched with many spiritual assets and thus enjoy the deep pleasures of the soul.

ईश्वरस्य विधिं को नु विधुनोत्यन्यथा पुमान् ।
भूमेर्भारावताराय योऽवतीर्णो यदो: कुले ॥ २८ ॥
īśvarasya vidhiṁ ko nu

bhūmer bhārāvatārāya
yo ’vatīrṇo yadoḥ kule

Translation
Who can defy the injunctions of the Supreme Lord, who has now descended in the Yadu dynasty to diminish the earth’s burden?
Purport
Naturally, we would like to ask Dhṛtarāṣṭra, “If you know all this, why don’t you behave properly?” Of course, this is exactly Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s point: he feels that since events have already been set in motion, he is helpless to change them. In fact, events have been set in motion by his attachment and sinful propensities, and therefore he should have taken responsibility for his own acts. Lord Kṛṣṇa clearly states in the Bhagavad-gītā (5.15), nādatte kasyacit pāpam: “The Supreme Lord does not accept responsibility for anyone’s sinful activities.” It is a dangerous policy to claim that we are acting improperly because of “destiny” or “fate.” We should take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously and create an auspicious future for ourselves and our associates.
Finally, one may argue that, after all, Dhṛtarāṣṭra is involved in the Lord’s pastimes and is actually His eternal associate. In answer to this we may say that the Lord’s pastimes are not only entertaining but also didactic, and the lesson here is that Dhṛtarāṣṭra should have acted properly. This is what the Lord wanted to teach. Dhṛtarāṣṭra claims that Kṛṣṇa came to relieve the burden of the earth, but the earth’s burden is precisely the improper behavior of its inhabitants. So, let us take the lesson the Lord wants to teach here and be instructed for our benefit.

यो दुर्विमर्शपथया निजमाययेदं

Translation
I offer my obeisances to Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who creates this universe by the inconceivable activity of His material energy and then distributes the various modes of nature by entering within the creation. From Him, the meaning of whose pastimes is unfathomable, come both the entangling cycle of birth and death and the process of deliverance from it.
Purport
When all is said and done, Dhṛtarāṣṭra was not an ordinary person but an associate of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Certainly an ordinary person could not offer such a learned hymn to the Lord.
