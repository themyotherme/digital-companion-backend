CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN

Lord Balarāma Slays Dvivida Gorilla
This chapter describes how Lord Baladeva enjoyed the company of the young girls of Vraja on Raivataka Mountain and killed the ape Dvivida there.
Narakāsura, a demon whom Lord Kṛṣṇa killed, had a friend named Dvivida, an ape. Dvivida wanted to avenge the death of his friend, so he set fire to the homes of the cowherds, devastated Lord Kṛṣṇa’s province of Ānarta and flooded coastal lands by churning the ocean’s water with his mighty arms. The rascal then tore down the trees in the āśramas of great sages and even passed stool and urine on their sacrificial fires. He kidnapped men and women and imprisoned them in mountain caves, which he sealed off with boulders. After thus disrupting the entire land and polluting many young women of respectable families, Dvivida came upon Raivataka Mountain, where he found Lord Baladeva enjoying in the company of a bevy of attractive women. Ignoring Lord Baladeva, who was apparently intoxicated from drinking vāruṇī liquor, Dvivida displayed his anus to the women right in front of the Lord and further insulted them by making crude gestures with his eyebrows and passing stool and urine.
Dvivida’s outrageous behavior angered Lord Baladeva, and He threw a stone at the ape. But Dvivida managed to dodge it. He then ridiculed Lord Baladeva and tugged at the women’s dresses. Seeing this audacity, Lord Baladeva decided to kill Dvivida. Thus He took up His club and His plow weapon. Powerful Dvivida then armed himself by pulling up a śāla tree from the ground, and with this tree he struck the Lord on the head. Lord Baladeva, however, remained unmoved and smashed the tree trunk to pieces. Dvivida uprooted another tree, and yet another and another, until the forest was denuded. But although he struck Baladeva on the head with one tree after another, the Lord simply broke all the trees to pieces. Then the foolish ape started throwing a barrage of stones. Lord Baladeva crushed them all to powder, after which Dvivida charged the Lord and hit Him on the chest with his fists, infuriating Him. Putting aside His club and plow weapons, Lord Balarāma then struck Dvivida’s throat and shoulder, at which point the ape vomited blood and fell down dead.
Having killed Dvivida, Lord Baladeva set off for Dvārakā as demigods and sages showered flowers from the sky and offered Him praises, prayers and obeisances.

श्रीशुक उवाच
नरकस्य सखा कश्चिद् द्विविदो नाम वानर: ।

śrī-śuka uvāca
narakasya sakhā kaścid
dvivido nāma vānaraḥ
sugrīva-sacivaḥ so ’tha
bhrātā maindasya vīryavān
Synonyms
śrī-śukaḥ uvāca — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; narakasya — of the demon Naraka; sakhā — friend; kaścit — a certain; dvividaḥ — Dvivida; nāma — by name; vānaraḥ — an ape; sugrīva — King Sugrīva; sacivaḥ — whose adviser; saḥ — he; atha — also; bhrātā — the brother; maindasya — of Mainda; vīrya-vān — powerful.
Translation
Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: There was an ape named Dvivida who was a friend of Narakāsura’s. This powerful Dvivida, the brother of Mainda, had been instructed by King Sugrīva.
Purport
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out some interesting facts about the ape Dvivida. Although Dvivida was an associate of Lord Rāmacandra’s, he later became corrupted by bad association with the demon Naraka, as stated here: narakasya sakhā. This bad association was the reaction for an offense Dvivida had committed when, being proud of his strength, he disrespected Lord Rāmacandra’s brother Lakṣmaṇa and others. Those who worship Lord Rāmacandra sometimes chant hymns addressed to Mainda and Dvivida, who are attendant deities of the Lord. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the Mainda and Dvivida mentioned in this verse are empowered expansions of these deities, who are residents of Lord Rāmacandra’s Vaikuṇṭha domain.
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura concurs with Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī’s view that Dvivida was ruined by bad association, which was a punishment for his having disrespected Śrīmān Lakṣmaṇa. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states, however, that the Mainda and Dvivida mentioned here are actually the eternally liberated devotees addressed as attendant deities during the worship of Lord Rāmacandra. The Lord arranged their degradation, he says, to show the evil of the bad association that results from offending great personalities. Thus Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī compares the fall of Dvivida and Mainda to that of Jaya and Vijaya.

In Kṛṣṇa Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “His first business was to set fires in villages, towns and industrial and mining places, as well as in the residential quarters of the mercantile men who were busy dairy farming and protecting cows.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “This gorilla by the name Dvivida could climb up into the trees and jump from one branch to another. Sometimes he would jerk the branches, creating a particular type of sound — kilakilā — so that Lord Balarāma was greatly distracted from the pleasing atmosphere.”

Further infuriating Lord Balarāma by laughing and by ridiculing Him, wicked Dvivida then broke the pot and offended the Lord even more by pulling at the girls’ clothing. Thus the powerful ape, puffed up with false pride, continued to insult Śrī Balarāma.

Lord Balarāma saw the ape’s rude behavior and thought of the disruptions he had created in the surrounding kingdoms. Thus the Lord angrily took up His club and His plow weapon, having decided to put His enemy to death.

The word avinayam means “without humility.” Dvivida, completely lacking in modesty and humility, shamelessly performed the most wicked activities. Lord Balarāma knew of the great disturbances Dvivida had caused to people in general, apart from the vulgar behavior the ape was exhibiting in the Lord’s own presence. The offensive ape would now have to die.

Ignoring the wound, Dvivida uprooted another tree, stripped it of leaves by brute force and struck the Lord again. Now enraged, Lord Balarāma shattered the tree into hundreds of pieces, upon which Dvivida grabbed yet another tree and furiously hit the Lord again. This tree, too, the Lord smashed into hundreds of pieces.

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “When no more trees were available, Dvivida took help from the hills and threw large pieces of stone, like rainfall, upon the body of Balarāma. Lord Balarāma, in a great sporting mood, began to smash those big pieces of stone into mere pebbles.” Even today there are many sports wherein people enjoy striking a ball or similar object with a stick or bat. This sporting propensity exists originally in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who playfully (līlayā) pulverized the deadly boulders hurled at Him by the powerful Dvivida.

Since the gorilla was striking Him with his hands, Lord Balarāma would not strike him back with His own weapons, the club or the plow. Simply with His fists He began to strike the collarbone of the gorilla. This striking proved to be fatal to Dvivida.”
