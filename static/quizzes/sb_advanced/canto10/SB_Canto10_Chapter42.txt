CHAPTER FORTY-TWO

The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow
This chapter describes the benediction Trivakrā received, the breaking of the sacrificial bow, the destruction of Kaṁsa’s soldiers, the inauspicious omens Kaṁsa saw and the festivities at the wrestling arena.
After leaving Sudāmā’s house, Lord Kṛṣṇa came upon Trivakrā, a young hunchbacked maidservant of Kaṁsa’s who was carrying a tray of fine ointments. The Lord asked her who she was and requested some ointment from her. Entranced by His beauty and joking words, Trivakrā gave both Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma a good deal of ointment. In return, Kṛṣṇa stepped on her toes with His lotus feet, took hold of her chin and lifted, thus straightening her spine. The now beautiful and charming Trivakrā then grabbed the edge of Kṛṣṇa’s upper cloth and asked Him to come to her house. Kṛṣṇa replied that after He had taken care of some business He would certainly come and relieve her mental torment. Then the two Lords continued Their sightseeing tour of Mathurā.
As Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma walked along the King’s road, the merchants worshiped Them with various offerings. Kṛṣṇa asked where the bow sacrifice was to take place, and when He arrived at the arena He saw the wonderful bow, which resembled Lord Indra’s. Despite the guards’ protests, Kṛṣṇa forcibly picked up the bow, easily strung it and in an instant broke it in half, producing an ear-splitting sound that filled the heavens and struck terror in the heart of Kaṁsa. The many guards attacked Kṛṣṇa, crying out “Seize Him! Kill Him!” But Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma simply picked up the two halves of the bow and beat the guards to death. Next the Lords annihilated a company of soldiers sent by Kaṁsa, and then They left the arena and continued Their tour.
When the people of the city saw the amazing prowess and beauty of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, they thought They must be two chief demigods. Indeed, as the residents of Mathurā gazed upon the Lords, they enjoyed all the blessings the gopīs had predicted.
At sunset Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma returned to the cowherds’ camp for Their evening meal. They then passed the night resting comfortably. But King Kaṁsa was not so fortunate. When he heard how Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had easily broken the mighty bow and destroyed his soldiers, he spent the night in great anxiety. Both while awake and while dreaming he saw many ill omens portending his imminent death, and his fear ruined any chance for rest.
At dawn the wrestling festival began. Crowds of people from the city and outlying districts entered the arena and took their seats in the lavishly decorated galleries. Kaṁsa, his heart trembling, sat down on the royal dais and invited Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherd men to come sit in their places, and they did so after offering him their gifts. The musical overture then began as the sounds of the wrestlers slapping their arms resounded.

श्रीशुक उवाच
अथ व्रजन् राजपथेन माधव:
स्त्रियं गृहीताङ्गविलेपभाजनाम् ।
विलोक्य कुब्जां युवतीं वराननां
पप्रच्छ यान्तीं प्रहसन् रसप्रद: ॥ १ ॥
śrī-śuka uvāca
atha vrajan rāja-pathena mādhavaḥ
striyaṁ gṛhītāṅga-vilepa-bhājanām
vilokya kubjāṁ yuvatīṁ varānanāṁ
papraccha yāntīṁ prahasan rasa-pradaḥ
Synonyms
śrī-śukaḥ uvāca — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; atha — then; vrajan — walking; rāja-pathena — along the King’s road; mādhavaḥ — Kṛṣṇa; striyam — a woman; gṛhīta — holding; aṅga — for the body; vilepa — with ointments; bhājanām — a tray; vilokya — seeing; kubjām — hunchbacked; yuvatīm — young; vara-ānanām — with an attractive face; papraccha — He inquired; yāntīm — going; prahasan — smiling; rasa — of the pleasure of love; pradaḥ — the bestower.
Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: As He walked down the King’s road, Lord Mādhava then saw a young hunchback woman with an attractive face, who carried a tray of fragrant ointments as she walked along. The bestower of the ecstasy of love smiled and inquired from her as follows.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the young hunchbacked girl was actually a partial expansion of the Lord’s wife Satyabhāmā. Satyabhāmā is the Lord’s internal energy known as Bhū-śakti, and this expansion of hers, known as Pṛthivī, represents the earth, which was bent down by the great burden of countless wicked rulers. Lord Kṛṣṇa descended to remove these wicked rulers, and thus His pastime of straightening out the hunchback Trivakrā, as explained in these verses, represents His rectifying the burdened condition of the earth. At the same time, the Lord awarded Trivakrā a conjugal relationship with Himself.
In addition to the given meaning, the word rasa-pradaḥ indicates that the Lord amused His cowherd boyfriends by His dealings with the young hunchback.

Purport
The Lord jokingly addressed the lady as varoru, “O beautiful-thighed one.” His joke was not malicious, since He was actually about to make her beautiful.

Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that Trivakrā, who is also known as Kubjā, used the singular address sundara, “O handsome one,” to hint that she felt conjugal desire for Kṛṣṇa alone, and she used the dual form yuvām, “for both of You,” to try to hide her conjugal sentiment. The hunchback’s name, Trivakrā, indicates that her body was bent at the neck, chest and waist.

Kṛṣṇa: But people here on the King’s road will misconstrue what you’re saying and laugh. Therefore please don’t speak like this.
Trivakrā: I can’t help being agitated. You made the mistake of touching me. It’s not my fault.

Purport
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that since the women of Mathurā immediately experienced symptoms of conjugal attraction when they saw Kṛṣṇa, they were the most advanced devotees in the city. The ten effects of Cupid are described as follows: cakṣū-rāgaḥ prathamaṁ cittāsaṅgas tato ’tha saṅkalpaḥ nidrā-cchedas tanutā viṣaya-nivṛttis trapā-nasaḥ/ unmādo mūrcchā mṛtir ity etāḥ smara-daśā daśaiva syuḥ. “First comes attraction expressed through the eyes, then intense attachment in the mind, then determination, loss of sleep, becoming emaciated, disinterest in external things, shamelessness, madness, becoming stunned and death. These are the ten stages of Cupid’s effects.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also points out that devotees who possess pure love of Godhead generally do not exhibit the symptom of death, since this is inauspicious in relation to Kṛṣṇa. They do, however, manifest the other nine symptoms, culminating in becoming stunned in ecstasy.

At the time of Mukunda’s [Kṛṣṇa’s] departure from Vṛndāvana, the gopīs had foretold that the residents of Mathurā would enjoy many benedictions, and now the gopīs’ predictions were coming true, for those residents were gazing upon the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, the jewel among men. Indeed, the goddess of fortune desired the shelter of that beauty so much that she abandoned many other men, although they worshiped her.

Translation
Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherds, summoned by the King of the Bhojas, presented him with their offerings and then took their seats in one of the galleries.
Purport
According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the word samāhutāḥ indicates that King Kaṁsa respectfully called the leaders of Vraja forward so that they could make their offerings to the central government. According to the ācārya, Kaṁsa assured Nanda as follows: “My dear King of Vraja, you are the most important of my village rulers. Yet even though you have come to Mathurā from your cowherd village, you have not come to visit me. Is that because you are frightened? Don’t think that your two sons are bad because They broke the bow. I invited Them here because I heard They were extremely powerful, and I’ve arranged this wrestling match as a test of Their strength. So please come forward without hesitation. Don’t be afraid.”
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further states that Nanda Mahārāja noticed his two sons were not present. Apparently, out of disrespect for King Kaṁsa’s order, They had taken the morning off and gone elsewhere.
Thus Kaṁsa delegated some cowherd men to go look for Them and advise Them to behave properly and come back to the wrestling arena. The ācārya also states that the reason Nanda and the other cowherd men sat in the galleries was that they could not find any sitting places on the royal dais.
Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Forty-second Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “The Breaking of the Sacrificial Bow.”
