Purport
In Bhagavad-gītā (7.3) it is stated, manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye: out of many millions of people, one may attempt to achieve success in life. This success is explained here. Rāddham indra-padaṁ hitvā tataḥ siddhim avāpsyati. Siddhi consists of achieving the favor of Lord Viṣṇu, not the yoga-siddhis. The yoga-siddhis — aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, vaśitva and kāmāvasāyitā — are temporary. The ultimate siddhi is to achieve the favor of Lord Viṣṇu.
