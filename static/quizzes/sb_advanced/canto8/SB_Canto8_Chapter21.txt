CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

Bali Mahārāja Arrested by the Lord
This chapter describes how Lord Viṣṇu, desiring to advertise the glories of Bali Mahārāja, arrested him for not fulfilling his promise in regard to the Lord’s third step.
With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails. Thus Lord Brahmā, accompanied by great sages like Marīci and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord. They washed the Lord’s feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia. Ṛkṣarāja, Jāmbavān, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord. When Bali Mahārāja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry. Although Bali Mahārāja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Viṣṇu. All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Viṣṇu’s eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Mahārāja’s order, they all entered the lower planets of the universe. Understanding Lord Viṣṇu’s purpose, Garuḍa, the carrier of Lord Viṣṇu, immediately arrested Bali Mahārāja with the ropes of Varuṇa. When Bali Mahārāja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Viṣṇu asked him for the third step of land. Because Lord Viṣṇu appreciated Bali Mahārāja’s determination and integrity, when Bali Mahārāja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Viṣṇu ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven.

Translation
Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: When Lord Brahmā, who was born of a lotus flower, saw that the effulgence of his residence, Brahmaloka, had been reduced by the glaring effulgence from the toenails of Lord Vāmanadeva, he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahmā was accompanied by all the great sages, headed by Marīci, and by yogīs like Sanandana, but in the presence of that glaring effulgence, O King, even Lord Brahmā and his associates seemed insignificant.

Translation
Among the great personalities who came to worship the lotus feet of the Lord were those who had attained perfection in self-control and regulative principles, as well as experts in logic, history, general education and the Vedic literature known as kalpe [dealing with old historical incidents]. Others were experts in the Vedic corollaries like Brahma-saṁhitā, all the other knowledge of the Vedas [Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg and Atharva], and also the supplementary Vedic knowledge [Āyurveda, Dhanurveda, etc.]. Others were those who had been freed of the reactions to fruitive activities by transcendental knowledge awakened by practice of yoga. And still others were those who had attained residence in Brahmaloka not by ordinary karma but by advanced Vedic knowledge. After devotedly worshiping the upraised lotus feet of the Supreme Lord with oblations of water, Lord Brahmā, who was born of the lotus emanating from Lord Viṣṇu’s navel, offered prayers to the Lord.

Synonyms
dhātuḥ — of Lord Brahmā; kamaṇḍalu-jalam — water from the kamaṇḍalu; tat — that; urukramasya — of Lord Viṣṇu; pāda-avanejana-pavitratayā — because of washing the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu and thus being transcendentally pure; nara-indra — O King; svardhunī — the river named Svardhunī of the celestial world; abhūt — so became; nabhasi — in outer space; sā — that water; patatī — flowing down; nimārṣṭi — purifying; loka-trayam — the three worlds; bhagavataḥ — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; viśadā — so purified; iva — just like; kīrtiḥ — the fame or the glorious activities.
Translation
O King, the water from Lord Brahmā’s kamaṇḍalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vāmanadeva, who is known as Urukrama, the wonderful actor. Thus that water became so pure that it was transformed into the water of the Ganges, which went flowing down from the sky, purifying the three worlds like the pure fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Purport
Here we understand that the Ganges began when the water from Lord Brahmā’s kamaṇḍalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vāmanadeva. But in the Fifth Canto it is stated that the Ganges began when Vāmanadeva’s left foot pierced the covering of the universe so that the transcendental water of the Causal Ocean leaked through. And elsewhere it is also stated that Lord Nārāyaṇa appeared as the water of the Ganges. The water of the Ganges, therefore, is a combination of three transcendental waters, and thus the Ganges is able to purify the three worlds. This is the description given by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.

Translation
Lord Brahmā and all the predominating deities of the various planetary systems began to worship Lord Vāmanadeva, their supreme master, who had reduced Himself from His all-pervading form to His original form. They collected all the ingredients and paraphernalia for this worship.
Purport
Vāmanadeva first expanded Himself to the universal form and then reduced Himself to the original Vāmana-rūpa. Thus He acted exactly like Lord Kṛṣṇa, who, at the request of Arjuna, first showed His universal form and later resumed His original form as Kṛṣṇa. The Lord can assume any form He likes, but His original form is that of Kṛṣṇa (kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam). According to the capacity of the devotee, the Lord assumes various forms so that the devotee can handle Him. This is His causeless mercy. When Lord Vāmanadeva resumed His original form, Lord Brahmā and his associates collected various paraphernalia for worship with which to please Him.

Purport
Bhagavad-gītā mentions five causes of defeat or victory. Of these five, daiva (providence) is the most powerful (na ca daivāt paraṁ balam). Bali Mahārāja knew the secret of how he had formerly been victorious because providence was in his favor. Now, since that same providence was not in his favor, there was no possibility of his victory. Thus he very intelligently forbade his associates to fight.

Purport
Garuḍa, the constant companion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knows the confidential part of the Lord’s desire. Bali Mahārāja’s tolerance and devotion were undoubtedly superexcellent. Garuḍa arrested Bali Mahārāja to show the entire universe the greatness of the King’s tolerance.

तं बद्धं वारुणै: पाशैर्भगवानाह वामन: ।
नष्टश्रियं स्थिरप्रज्ञमुदारयशसं नृप ॥ २८ ॥
taṁ baddhaṁ vāruṇaiḥ pāśair
bhagavān āha vāmanaḥ
naṣṭa-śriyaṁ sthira-prajñam
udāra-yaśasaṁ nṛpa
Synonyms
tam — unto him; baddham — who was so arrested; vāruṇaiḥ pāśaiḥ — by the ropes of Varuṇa; bhagavān — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; āha — said; vāmanaḥ — Vāmanadeva; naṣṭa-śriyam — unto Bali Mahārāja, who had lost his bodily luster; sthira-prajñam — but was all the same determined in his decision; udāra-yaśasam — the most magnanimous and celebrated; nṛpa — O King.
Translation
O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāmanadeva, then spoke to Bali Mahārāja, the most liberal and celebrated personality whom He had arrested with the ropes of Varuṇa. Bali Mahārāja had lost all bodily luster, but he was nonetheless fixed in his determination.
Purport
When one is bereft of all his possessions, he is certainly reduced in bodily luster. But although Bali Mahārāja had lost everything, he was fixed in his determination to satisfy Vāmanadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gītā, such a person is called sthita-prajña. A pure devotee is never deviated from the service of the Lord, despite all difficulties and impediments offered by the illusory energy. Generally men who have wealth and opulence are famous, but Bali Mahārāja became famous for all time by being deprived of all his possessions. This is the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead toward His devotees. The Lord says, yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ. As the first installment of His special favor, the Lord takes away all the possessions of His devotee. A devotee, however, is never disturbed by such a loss. He continues his service, and the Lord amply rewards him, beyond the expectations of any common man.

प्रतिश्रुतमदातुस्ते निरये वास इष्यते ।
विश त्वं निरयं तस्माद् गुरुणा चानुमोदित: ॥ ३२ ॥
pratiśrutam adātus te
niraye vāsa iṣyate
viśa tvaṁ nirayaṁ tasmād
guruṇā cānumoditaḥ
Synonyms
pratiśrutam — what had been promised; adātuḥ — who could not give; te — of you; niraye — in hell; vāsaḥ — residence; iṣyate — prescribed; viśa — now enter; tvam — yourself; nirayam — the hellish planet; tasmāt — therefore; guruṇā — by your spiritual master; ca — also; anumoditaḥ — approved.
Translation
Because you have been unable to give charity according to your promise, the rule is that you should go down to live in the hellish planets. Therefore, in accordance with the order of Śukrācārya, your spiritual master, now go down and live there.
Purport
It is said:
nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve
na kutaścana bibhyati
svargāpavarga-narakeṣv
api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ
“Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.” (Bhāg. 6.17.28) A devotee engaged in the service of Nārāyaṇa is always in equilibrium. A devotee actually lives transcendentally. Although he may appear to have gone to hell or heaven, he does not live in either place; rather, he always lives in Vaikuṇṭha (sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate). Vāmanadeva asked Bali Mahārāja to go to the hellish planets, apparently just to show the entire universe how tolerant he was, and Bali Mahārāja did not hesitate to carry out the order. A devotee does not live alone. Of course, everyone lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because the devotee is engaged in His service, he actually does not live in any material condition. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, kīṭa janma hao yathā tuyā dāsa. Thus he prays to take birth as an insignificant insect in the association of devotees. Because devotees are engaged in the service of the Lord, anyone who lives with them also lives in Vaikuṇṭha.

vṛthā manorathas tasya
dūraḥ svargaḥ pataty adhaḥ
pratiśrutasyādānena
yo ’rthinaṁ vipralambhate
Synonyms
vṛthā — without any good result; manorathaḥ — mental concoction; tasya — of him; dūraḥ — far away; svargaḥ — elevation to the higher planetary system; patati — falls down; adhaḥ — to a hellish condition of life; pratiśrutasya — things promised; adānena — being unable to give; yaḥ — anyone who; arthinam — a beggar; vipralambhate — cheats.
Translation
Far from being elevated to the heavenly planets or fulfilling one’s desire, one who does not properly give a beggar what he has promised falls down to a hellish condition of life.
Text 34
विप्रलब्धो ददामीति त्वयाहं चाढ्यमानिना ।
तद् व्यलीकफलं भुङ्‌क्ष्व निरयं कतिचित् समा: ॥ ३४ ॥
vipralabdho dadāmīti
tvayāhaṁ cāḍhya-māninā

nirayaṁ katicit samāḥ
Synonyms

Translation
Being falsely proud of your possessions, you promised to give Me land, but you could not fulfill your promise. Therefore, because your promise was false, you must live for a few years in hellish life.
Purport
The false prestige of thinking “I am very rich, and I possess such vast property” is another side of material life. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else possesses anything. This is the real fact. īśāvāsyam idaṁ samaṁ yat kiñca jagatyāṁ jagat. Bali Mahārāja was undoubtedly the most exalted devotee, whereas previously he had maintained a misunderstanding due to false prestige. By the supreme will of the Lord, he now had to go to the hellish planets, but because he went there by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he lived there more opulently than one could expect to live in the planets of heaven. A devotee always lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, engaging in His service, and therefore he is always transcendental to hellish or heavenly residences.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled “Bali Mahārāja Arrested by the Lord”
