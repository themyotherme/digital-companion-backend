CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

The Dynasty of Bharata
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamīḍha and others.
The son of Bharadvāja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Bṛhatkṣatra, Jaya, Mahāvīrya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Saṅkṛti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a brāhmaṇa guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the brāhmaṇa. When the brāhmaṇa left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a śūdra appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the śūdra and himself. Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.
Garga, the son of Bharadvāja, had a son named Śini, and Śini’s son was Gārgya. Although Gārgya was a kṣatriya by birth, his sons became brāhmaṇas. The son of Mahāvīrya was Duritakṣaya, whose sons were Trayyāruṇi, Kavi and Puṣkarāruṇi. Although these three sons were born of a kṣatriya king, they also achieved the position of brāhmaṇas. The son of Bṛhatkṣatra constructed the city of Hastināpura and was known as Hastī. His sons were Ajamīḍha, Dvimīḍha and Purumīḍha.
From Ajamīḍha came Priyamedha and other brāhmaṇas and also a son named Bṛhadiṣu. The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Bṛhadiṣu were Bṛhaddhanu, Bṛhatkāya, Jayadratha, Viśada and Syenajit. From Syenajit came four sons — Rucirāśva, Dṛḍhahanu, Kāśya and Vatsa. From Rucirāśva came a son named Pāra, whose sons were Pṛthusena and Nīpa, and from Nīpa came one hundred sons. Another son of Nīpa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Viṣvaksena; from Viṣvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallāṭa.
The son of Dvimīḍha was Yavīnara, and from Yavīnara came many sons and grandsons, such as Kṛtimān, Satyadhṛti, Dṛḍhanemi, Supārśva, Sumati, Sannatimān, Kṛtī, Nīpa, Udgrāyudha, Kṣemya, Suvīra, Ripuñjaya and Bahuratha. Purumīḍha had no sons, but Ajamīḍha, in addition to his other sons, had a son named Nīla, whose son was Śānti. The descendants of Śānti were Suśānti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyāśva. Bharmyāśva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brāhmaṇas. Mudgala had twins — a son, Divodāsa, and a daughter, Ahalyā. From Ahalyā, by her husband, Gautama, Śatānanda was born. The son of Śatānanda was Satyadhṛti, and his son was Śaradvān. Śaradvān’s son was known as Kṛpa, and Śaradvān’s daughter, known as Kṛpī, became the wife of Droṇācārya.

viyat-vittasya — of Rantideva, who received things sent by providence, just as the cātaka bird receives water from the sky; dadataḥ — who distributed to others; labdham — whatever he got; labdham — such gains; bubhukṣataḥ — he enjoyed; niṣkiñcanasya — always penniless; dhīrasya — yet very sober; sa-kuṭumbasya — even with his family members; sīdataḥ — suffering very much; vyatīyuḥ — passed by; aṣṭa-catvāriṁśat — forty-eight; ahāni — days; apibataḥ — without even drinking water; kila — indeed; ghṛta-pāyasa — food prepared with ghee and milk; saṁyāvam — varieties of food grains; toyam — water; prātaḥ — in the morning; upasthitam — arrived by chance; kṛcchra-prāpta — undergoing suffering; kuṭumbasya — whose family members; kṣut-tṛḍbhyām — by thirst and hunger; jāta — became; vepathoḥ — trembling; atithiḥ — a guest; brāhmaṇaḥ — a brāhmaṇa; kāle — just at that time; bhoktu-kāmasya — of Rantideva, who desired to eat something; ca — also; āgamat — arrived there.
Translation
Rantideva never endeavored to earn anything. He would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of providence, but when guests came he would give them everything. Thus he underwent considerable suffering, along with the members of his family. Indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and water, yet Rantideva always remained sober. Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and his family were about to eat, a brāhmaṇa guest arrived.

तस्मै संव्यभजत् सोऽन्नमाद‍ृत्य श्रद्धयान्वित: ।
हरिं सर्वत्र संपश्यन् स भुक्त्वा प्रययौ द्विज: ॥ ६ ॥
tasmai saṁvyabhajat so ’nnam
ādṛtya śraddhayānvitaḥ
hariṁ sarvatra saṁpaśyan
sa bhuktvā prayayau dvijaḥ
Synonyms
tasmai — unto him (the brāhmaṇa); saṁvyabhajat — after dividing, gave his share; saḥ — he (Rantideva); annam — the food; ādṛtya — with great respect; śraddhayā anvitaḥ — and with faith; harim — the Supreme Lord; sarvatra — everywhere, or in the heart of every living being; saṁpaśyan — conceiving; saḥ — he; bhuktvā — after eating the food; prayayau — left that place; dvijaḥ — the brāhmaṇa..
Translation
Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead everywhere, and in every living entity, he received the guest with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The brāhmaṇa guest ate his share and then went away.
Purport
Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord both in the brāhmaṇa and in the caṇḍāla. This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gītā (5.18):
vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].” A paṇḍita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-nārāyaṇa, or “poor Nārāyaṇa,” Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Nārāyaṇa is present in the heart of one who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-nārāyaṇa is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Nārāyaṇa. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ). It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Māyāvāda philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.

अथान्यो भोक्ष्यमाणस्य विभक्तस्य महीपते: ।
विभक्तं व्यभजत् तस्मै वृषलाय हरिं स्मरन् ॥ ७ ॥
athānyo bhokṣyamāṇasya
vibhaktasya mahīpateḥ
vibhaktaṁ vyabhajat tasmai
vṛṣalāya hariṁ smaran
Synonyms
atha — thereafter; anyaḥ — another guest; bhokṣyamāṇasya — who was just about to eat; vibhaktasya — after setting aside the share for the family; mahīpateḥ — of the King; vibhaktam — the food allotted for the family; vyabhajat — he divided and distributed; tasmai — unto him; vṛṣalāya — unto a śūdra; harim — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; smaran — remembering.
Translation
Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a śūdra guest arrived. Seeing the śūdra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.
Purport
Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he never distinguished between the brāhmaṇa and the śūdra, the poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called sama-darśinaḥ (paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ). One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the brāhmaṇa and the śūdra, the poor (daridra) and the rich (dhanī). Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.

Translation
When the śūdra went away, another guest arrived, surrounded by dogs, and said, “O King, I and my company of dogs are very hungry. Please give us something to eat.”

Translation
With great respect, King Rantideva offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs, who had come as guests. The King offered them all respects and obeisances.

pānīya-mātram — only the drinking water; uccheṣam — what remained of the food; tat ca — that also; eka — for one; paritarpaṇam — satisfying; pāsyataḥ — when the King was about to drink; pulkasaḥ — a caṇḍāla; abhyāgāt — came there; apaḥ — water; dehi — please give; aśubhāya — although I am a lowborn caṇḍāla; me — to me.
Translation
Thereafter, only the drinking water remained, and there was only enough to satisfy one person, but when the King was just about to drink it, a caṇḍāla appeared and said, “O King, although I am lowborn, kindly give me some drinking water.”

tasya tāṁ karuṇāṁ vācaṁ

tasya — of him (the caṇḍāla); tām — those; karuṇām — pitiable; vācam — words; niśamya — hearing; vipula — very much; śramām — fatigued; kṛpayā — out of compassion; bhṛśa-santaptaḥ — very much aggrieved; idam — these; āha — spoke; amṛtam — very sweet; vacaḥ — words.
Translation
Aggrieved at hearing the pitiable words of the poor fatigued caṇḍāla, Mahārāja Rantideva spoke the following nectarean words.
Purport
Mahārāja Rantideva’s words were like amṛta, or nectar, and therefore, aside from rendering bodily service to an aggrieved person, by his words alone the King could save the life of anyone who might hear him.

aṣṭarddhi-yuktām apunar-bhavaṁ vā
ārtiṁ prapadye ’khila-deha-bhājām
antaḥ-sthito yena bhavanty aduḥkhāḥ
Synonyms
na — not; kāmaye — desire; aham — I; gatim — destination; īśvarāt — from the Supreme Personality of Godhead; parām — great; aṣṭa-ṛddhi-yuktām — composed of the eight kinds of mystic perfection; apunaḥ-bhavam — cessation of repeated birth (liberation, salvation); vā — either; ārtim — sufferings; prapadye — I accept; akhila-deha-bhājām — of all living entities; antaḥ-sthitaḥ — staying among them; yena — by which; bhavanti — they become; aduḥkhāḥ — without distress.
Translation
I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the eight perfections of mystic yoga, nor for salvation from repeated birth and death. I want only to stay among all the living entities and suffer all distresses on their behalf, so that they may be freed from suffering.
Purport
Vāsudeva Datta made a similar statement to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, requesting the Lord to liberate all living entities in His presence. Vāsudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaiṣṇava is therefore described as being para-duḥkha-duḥkhī, very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiṣṇava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society.

ātmānaṁ darśayāṁ cakrur

tasya — before him (King Rantideva); tri-bhuvana-adhīśāḥ — the controllers of the three worlds (demigods like Brahmā and Śiva); phaladāḥ — who can bestow all fruitive results; phalam icchatām — of persons who desire material benefit; ātmānam — their own identities; darśayām cakruḥ — manifested; māyāḥ — the illusory energy; viṣṇu — by Lord Viṣṇu; vinirmitāḥ — created.
Translation
Demigods like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, who can satisfy all materially ambitious men by giving them the rewards they desire, then manifested their own identities before King Rantideva, for it was they who had presented themselves as the brāhmaṇa, śūdra, caṇḍāla and so on.
Text 16

sa vai tebhyo namaskṛtya

Synonyms
saḥ — he (King Rantideva); vai — indeed; tebhyaḥ — unto Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the other demigods; namaḥ-kṛtya — offering obeisances; niḥsaṅgaḥ — with no ambition to take any benefit from them; vigata-spṛhaḥ — completely free from desires for material possessions; vāsudeve — unto Lord Vāsudeva; bhagavati — the Supreme Lord; bhaktyā — by devotional service; cakre — fixed; manaḥ — the mind; param — as the ultimate goal of life.
Translation
King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from the demigods. He offered them obeisances, but because he was factually attached to Lord Viṣṇu, Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he fixed his mind at Lord Viṣṇu’s lotus feet.
Purport
Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:
anya devāśraya nāi, tomāre kahinu bhāi,
ei bhakti parama karaṇa
If one wants to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, one should not hanker to take benedictions from the demigods. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā (7.20), kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ: those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, he did not hanker to take material benefits from them. Rather, he fixed his mind upon Lord Vāsudeva and rendered devotional service unto Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is not adulterated by material desires.
anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”

ईश्वरालम्बनं चित्तं कुर्वतोऽनन्यराधस: ।

īśvarālambanaṁ cittaṁ
kurvato ’nanya-rādhasaḥ
māyā guṇamayī rājan
svapnavat pratyalīyata
Synonyms
īśvara-ālambanam — completely taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord; cittam — his consciousness; kurvataḥ — fixing; ananya-rādhasaḥ — for Rantideva, who was undeviating and desired nothing other than to serve the Supreme Lord; māyā — the illusory energy; guṇa-mayī — consisting of the three modes of nature; rājan — O Mahārāja Parīkṣit; svapna-vat — like a dream; pratyalīyata — merged.
Translation
O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, because King Rantideva was a pure devotee, always Kṛṣṇa conscious and free from all material desires, the Lord’s illusory energy, māyā, could not exhibit herself before him. On the contrary, for him māyā entirely vanished, exactly like a dream.
Purport
As it is said:
kṛṣṇa — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra
yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa, tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure Kṛṣṇa conscious person there can be no existence of māyā. The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gītā (7.14):
daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī
mama māyā duratyayā
mām eva ye prapadyante
māyām etāṁ taranti te
“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.” If one wants to be free from the influence of māyā, the illusory energy, one must become Kṛṣṇa conscious and always keep Kṛṣṇa prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-gītā (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru). In this way, by always being Kṛṣṇa-minded or Kṛṣṇa conscious, one can surpass the influence of māyā (māyām etāṁ taranti te). Because Rantideva was Kṛṣṇa conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word svapnavat is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one’s dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Kṛṣṇa conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.

तत्प्रसङ्गानुभावेन रन्तिदेवानुवर्तिन: ।

tat-prasaṅgānubhāvena
rantidevānuvartinaḥ
abhavan yoginaḥ sarve
nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ
Synonyms
tat-prasaṅga-anubhāvena — because of associating with King Rantideva (when talking with him about bhakti-yoga); rantideva-anuvartinaḥ — the followers of King Rantideva (that is, his servants, his family members, his friends and others); abhavan — became; yoginaḥ — first-class mystic yogīs, or bhakti-yogīs; sarve — all of them; nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ — devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa.
Translation
All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were totally favored by his mercy and became pure devotees, attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa. Thus they all became the best of yogīs.
Purport
The best yogīs or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gītā (6.47):
yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
mad-gatenāntarātmanā
śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
“Of all yogīs, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.” The best yogī is he who constantly thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, by the king’s transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said that a Vaiṣṇava is meritorious in proportion to the number of devotees he has created. A Vaiṣṇava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word rantidevānuvartinaḥ indicates that Rantideva’s officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaiṣṇavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or mahā-bhāgavata. Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ: one should render service to such mahātmās, for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has also said, chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā: one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaiṣṇava, the door to liberation is open.

ajamīḍho dvimīḍhaś ca

Synonyms
ajamīḍhaḥ — Ajamīḍha; dvimīḍhaḥ — Dvimīḍha; ca — also; purumīḍhaḥ — Purumīḍha; ca — also; hastinaḥ — became the sons of Hastī; ajamīḍhasya — of Ajamīḍha; vaṁśyāḥ — descendants; syuḥ — are; priyamedha-ādayaḥ — headed by Priyamedha; dvijāḥ — brāhmaṇas..
Translation
From King Hastī came three sons, named Ajamīḍha, Dvimīḍha and Purumīḍha. The descendants of Ajamīḍha, headed by Priyamedha, all achieved the position of brāhmaṇas.
Purport
This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of Bhagavad-gītā that the orders of society — brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra — are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ). All the descendants of Ajamīḍha, who was a kṣatriya, became brāhmaṇas. This was certainly because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons of brāhmaṇas or kṣatriyas become vaiśyas (brāhmaṇa-vaiśyatāṁ gatāḥ). When a kṣatriya or brāhmaṇa adopts the occupation or duty of a vaiśya (kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyam), he is certainly counted as a vaiśya. On the other hand, if one is born a vaiśya, by his activities he can become a brāhmaṇa. This is confirmed by Nārada Muni. Yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam. The members of the varṇas, or social orders — brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra — must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.

Purport
The Śuka mentioned here is different from the Śukadeva Gosvāmī who spoke Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, is described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa. There it is said that Vyāsadeva maintained the daughter of Jābāli as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of māyā. Vyāsadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by māyā, but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children. Vyāsadeva then went to Dvārakā and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyāsadeva’s request, went to Vyāsadeva’s cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by māyā. Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a parivrājakācārya. When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the boy created a duplicate Śukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the śuka-kanyā, or daughter of Śukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Śukadeva. The original Śukadeva was a lifelong brahmacārī.
